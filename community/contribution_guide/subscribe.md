# Subscribe Mailing Lists

It is highly recommended to subscribe to the development mailing list to keep up-to-date with the community.

In the process of using Seatunnel, if you have any questions or ideas, suggestions, you can participate in the Seatunnel community building through the Apache mailing list. Sending a subscription email is also very simple, the steps are as follows:

1. Send an email without any contents or subject to LISTNAME-subscribe@seatunnel.apache.org. (replace LISTNAME with dev, commits,users...)

If you send us an email with a code snippet, make sure that:
* you do not link to files in external services as such files can change, get deleted, or the link might break and thus make an archived email thread useless.
* you paste text instead of screenshots of text.
* you keep formatting when pasting code in order to keep the code readable.
* there are enough import statements to avoid ambiguities.
* if you are using some platform, please specify the version.

2. Receive confirmation email and reply. After completing step 1, you will receive a confirmation email from LISTNAME-help@seatunnel.apache.org (if not received, please confirm whether the email is automatically classified as spam, promotion email, subscription email, etc.) . Then reply directly to the email, or click on the link in the email to reply quickly, the subject and content are arbitrary.
