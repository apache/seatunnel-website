This is a high-profile release with many important function updates and optimizations.</em>
<em>At the level of programming user experience, the new version improves the stability of SeaTunnel Zeta and CI/CD; at the level of connectors, the new version implements 7+ new connectors and fixes existing commonly used connectors bugs, and improved security. The community refactored multiple underlying base classes and added an important feature, AI Compatible. With the optimized API, users can use ChatGPT 4.0 to quickly build the SaaS Connector they need.</em></p><h1>Major Feature update</h1></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="01-seatunnel-zeta">01 SeaTunnel Zeta<a href="#01-seatunnel-zeta" class="hash-link" aria-label="01 SeaTunnel Zeta的直接链接" title="01 SeaTunnel Zeta的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>The first version of the data integration engine-SeaTunnel Zeta is introduced in the SeaTunnel 2.3.0 release and has received feedback from numerous community users. In SeaTunnel version 2.3.1, we have fixed all the bugs reported by users, optimized the use of memory and threads, and greatly improved the stability of Zeta.</p><p>In version 2.3.1, the community also added several new Zeta features, including a dedicated JVM parameter configuration file, client output of job monitoring information, Rest API for Zeta cluster information and job information, etc.</p><p>At the checkpoint level, version 2.3.1 Zeta supports using OSS as checkpoint storage. It also supports savepoint running jobs and resuming jobs from savepoints.</p><p>In addition, version 2.3.1 also adds a set of Zeta’s Rest API, which can be used to obtain the list of jobs running on Zeta, the status information of jobs, and the monitoring indicators of Zeta cluster nodes. For specific usage methods, please refer to <strong>https:/ /seatunnel.apache.org/docs/seatunnel-engine/rest-api/</strong></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="02-ai-compatible">02 AI Compatible<a href="#02-ai-compatible" class="hash-link" aria-label="02 AI Compatible的直接链接" title="02 AI Compatible的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>In SeaTunnel 2.3.1, the HTTP interface and related APIs are reconstructed, and the SaaS Connector-related API and Connector construction process are simplified according to the existing xGPT level capabilities so that ChatGPT 4.0 can directly generate SaaS Connectors and quickly generate various SaaS Connector interfaces. Under normal circumstances, the results obtained by this method are 95% similar to the code written by open-source contributors (see appendix).</p><p>Of course, because ChatGPT4.0 will be updated in October 2021, it is necessary to provide some latest vectorized documents for the latest SaaS interface adaptation to have the latest interface adaptation. However, this refactored API and code framework allows users to generate Connectors more quickly and contribute to the open-source community, making the SeaTunnel interface more powerful.</p><h1>Connector</h1><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="01-7-new-connectors">01 7+ new connectors<a href="#01-7-new-connectors" class="hash-link" aria-label="01 7+ new connectors的直接链接" title="01 7+ new connectors的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>While fixing the bugs of known connectors and optimizing the connectors, the community has added 7 new connectors including SAP HANA, Persistiq, TDEngine, SelectDB Cloud, Hbase, FieldMapper Transform, and SimpleSQL Transform.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="02-reimplement-sql-transform">02 Reimplement SQL Transform<a href="#02-reimplement-sql-transform" class="hash-link" aria-label="02 Reimplement SQL Transform的直接链接" title="02 Reimplement SQL Transform的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>Since the previous SQL Transform connector was defined based on Flink SQL and Spark SQL, SQL Transform cannot adapt to the execution of multiple engines, so we removed the SQL Transform function in version 2.3.0. In version 2.3.1, we reimplemented SQL Transform. SQL Transform is an API that does not depend on a task-specific execution engine and can perfectly run on three different engines: Flink/Spark/Zeta. Special thanks to contributor Ma Chengyuan (GitHub ID: rewerma) for leading and contributing this important Feature.</p><p>For the functions already supported by SQL Transform, please refer to <a href="https://seatunnel.apache.org/docs/2.3.1/transform-v2/sql-functions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://seatunnel.apache.org/docs/2.3.1/transform-v2/sql-functions</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="03-new-sql-server-cdc">03 New SQL Server CDC<a href="#03-new-sql-server-cdc" class="hash-link" aria-label="03 New SQL Server CDC的直接链接" title="03 New SQL Server CDC的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>At the CDC connector level, the community has newly added a SQL Server CDC connector, and made a lot of optimizations to MySQL CDC, improving the stability of MySQL CDC.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="04-added-cdc-connector-to-output-debezium-json-format-function">04 Added CDC connector to output debezium-json format function<a href="#04-added-cdc-connector-to-output-debezium-json-format-function" class="hash-link" aria-label="04 Added CDC connector to output debezium-json format function的直接链接" title="04 Added CDC connector to output debezium-json format function的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>In addition, version 2.3.1 also added the function of the CDC connector to output debezium-json format. Users can use MySQL CDC to read binlog and output data in debezium-json format to Kafka, so that users can create new synchronization tasks to read The data in debezium-json format in Kafka is synchronized to the target data source, or you can directly write other programs to read the data in debezium-json format in Kafka to perform some indicator calculations.</p><h1>Safety</h1><p>Before version 2.3.1, users need to configure the database username, password, and other information in plain text in the config file, which may cause some security problems. In version 2.3.1, we added the configuration file encryption function, and users can fill in the encrypted database username, password, and other information in the config file. When the job is running, SeaTunnel will decrypt the content in the config file based on the default encryption and decryption algorithm. At the same time, the encryption function provides SPI, by which users can customize the parameter list of encryption and decryption and the algorithm of encryption and decryption based on their own needs.</p><p>For how to use this function, please refer to <a href="https://seatunnel.apache.org/docs/2.3.1/connector-v2/Config-Encryption-Decryption" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://seatunnel.apache.org/docs/2.3.1/connector-v2/Config-Encryption-Decryption</a></p><h1>Third-party engine support</h1><p>SeaTunnel version 2.3.1 supports Spark version 3.3, as well as Flink 1.14.6, Flink 1.15, Flink 1.16, and other versions, basically covering the mainstream versions of Spark and Flink.</p><h1>Client</h1><p>The new version introduces an SPI for job configuration. Previously, only hocon json configuration files were supported. Now SPI is opened to the users to customize the format of job configuration files to meet different business system integration requirements.</p><h1>Optimization</h1><p>SeaTunnel 2.1.3 version has made many important optimizations, including changes in core components, connector components, CI/CD, Zeta(ST-Engine), and E2E components, involving updating new functions, improving existing functions, and optimizing tests and deployment processes. Some notable changes include adding parallelism and column projection interfaces in Core API, introducing MySQL-CDC source factory in Connector-V2 and supporting only-once semantics for JDBC source connectors, improving CI/CD process and stability for E2E In Zeta (ST-Engine), the logic of restarting the job when all nodes are down is added, and the timeout period for writing data is configurable.</p><p>For a detailed list, see the Release Note <!-- -->[Improve]<!-- --> section.</p><h1>Document</h1><p>In addition, the new version also has a series of updates to the documentation, including adding transform v2 documentation and some hints, as well as improving the documentation of various connectors.</p><p>See the Release Note <!-- -->[Docs]<!-- --> section for details.</p><p>Document address: <a href="https://seatunnel.apache.org/versions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://seatunnel.apache.org/versions/</a></p><h1>Release Note</h1><p><a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-seatunnel/blob/2.3.1/release-note.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/apache/incubator-seatunnel/blob/2.3.1/release-note.md</a></p><ul><li>Project address: <a href="https://seatunnel.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://seatunnel.apache.org/</a></li><li>Download address: <a href="https://seatunnel.apache.org/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://seatunnel.apache.org/download</a></li></ul><h1>Acknowledgement to the contributors</h1><p><img loading="lazy" alt="contributors" src="/zh-CN/assets/images/contributors-d048b07cc9a14c93d2d0ac41bdaae446.png" width="687" height="712" class="img_ev3q"></p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="description" content="cover"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/zh-CN/blog/2023/3/29/Performance_Test_Report_SeaTunnel_Synchronizes_Data_in_Batches_420_Percent_Faster_than_GLUE.md">Performance Test Report: SeaTunnel Synchronizes data in batches 420% Faster than GLUE!</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-03-29T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">2023年3月29日</time> · <!-- -->阅读需 3 分钟</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p>cover</p><p>SeaTunnel Zeta has been officially released with the joint efforts of the community.

SeaTunnel categorizes the captured data changes into the following 4 types: </p><ul><li>INSERT: Data insertion </li><li>UPDATE_BEFORE: Historical value before data change </li><li>UPDATE_AFTER: New value after data change </li><li>DELETE: Data deletion </li></ul><p>To handle the above data change operations, the Sink Connector needs to support writing behavior. This article will introduce how the ClickHouse Sink Connector supports writing these CDC types of data changes. </p><p>For CDC scenarios, the primary key is a necessary condition, so first, it needs to support the general requirements of INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc. based on the primary key and ensure that the writing order is consistent with the CDC event order. In addition, considering the complexity of the data source in practice, it also needs to support UPSERT writing. Finally, according to the characteristics of ClickHouse itself, corresponding optimizations need to be made, such as UPDATE and DELETE being heavyweight operations in ClickHouse, which should be optimized based on the corresponding table engine&#x27;s characteristics.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overall-design">Overall design<a href="#overall-design"

Why do we self-develop the big data synchronization engine SeaTunnel Zeta?
<a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-seatunnel/issues/1954" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/apache/incubator-seatunnel/issues/1954</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="02-design-ideas">02 Design ideas<a href="#02-design-ideas" class="hash-link" aria-label="02 Design ideas的直接链接" title="02 Design ideas的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>The general idea of engine design is as follows:</p><ol><li>Simple and easy to use, the new engine minimizes the dependence on third-party services, and can realize cluster management, snapshot storage, and cluster HA functions without relying on big data components such as Zookeeper and HDFS. This is very useful for users who do not have a big data platform or are unwilling to rely on a big data platform for data synchronization.</li><li>More resource-saving, at the CPU level, Zeta Engine internally uses Dynamic Thread Sharing (dynamic thread sharing) technology. In the real-time synchronization scenario, if the number of tables is large but the amount of data in each table is small, Zeta Engine will Synchronous tasks run in shared threads, which can reduce unnecessary thread creation and save system resources. On the read and data write side, the Zeta Engine is designed to minimize the number of JDBC connections. In the CDC scenario, Zeta Engine will try to reuse log reading and parsing resources as much as possible.</li><li>More stable. In this version, Zeta Engine uses Pipeline as the minimum granularity of Checkpoint and fault tolerance for data synchronization tasks. The failure of a task will only affect the tasks that have upstream and downstream relationships with it. Try to avoid task failures that cause the entire Job to fail. or rollback. At the same time, for scenarios where the source data has a storage time limit, Zeta Engine supports enabling data cache to automatically cache the data read from the source, and then the downstream tasks read the cached data and write it to the target. In this scenario, even if the target end fails and data cannot be written, it will not affect the normal reading of the source end, preventing the source end data from being deleted due to expiration.</li><li>Faster, Zeta Engine’s execution plan optimizer will optimize the execution plan to reduce the possible network transmission of data, thereby reducing the loss of overall synchronization performance caused by data serialization and deserialization, and completing faster Data synchronization operations. Of course, it also supports speed limiting, so that sync jobs can be performed at a reasonable speed.</li><li>Data synchronization support for all scenarios. SeaTunnel aims to support full synchronization and incremental synchronization under offline batch synchronization, and support real-time synchronization and CDC.</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="03-architecture-design">03 Architecture design<a href="#03-architecture-design" class="hash-link" aria-label="03 Architecture design的直接链接" title="03 Architecture design的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>SeaTunnel Engine is mainly composed of a set of APIs for data synchronization processing and a core computing engine.

To achieve cluster autonomy and job fault tolerance without relying on third-party service components (such as Zookeeper), SeaTunnel Engine uses Hazelcast as the underlying dependency. Hazelcast provides a distributed memory network, allowing users to operate a distributed collection like a normal Java collection locally. SeaTunnel saves the status information of the job in the memory grid of Hazelcast. When the Master node switches, it can Job state recovery based on data in the Hazelcast in-memory grid. At the same time, we have also implemented the persistence of Hazelcast memory grid data, and persisted the job status information to the storage (database of JDBC protocol, HDFS, cloud storage) in the form of WAL. In this way, even if the entire cluster hangs and restarts, the runtime information of the job can be repaired.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="data-cache">Data cache<a href="#data-cache" class="hash-link" aria-label="Data cache的直接链接" title="Data cache的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>SeaTunnel Engine is different from the traditional Spark/Flink computing engine, it is an engine specially used for data synchronization. The SeaTunnel engine naturally supports data cache. When multiple synchronous jobs in the cluster share a data source, the SeaTunnel engine will automatically enable the data cache. The source of a job will read the data and write it into the cache, and all other jobs will no longer read data from the data source but are automatically optimized to read data from the Cache. The advantage of this is that it can reduce the reading pressure of the data source and reduce the impact of data synchronization on the data source.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="speed-control">Speed control<a href="#speed-control" class="hash-link" aria-label="Speed control的直接链接" title="Speed control的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>SeaTunnel Engine supports the speed limit during data synchronization, which is very useful when reading data sources with high concurrency. A reasonable speed limit can not only ensure that the data is synchronized on time, but also minimize the pressure on the data source.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="shared-connection-pool-to-reduce-database-pressure">Shared connection pool to reduce database pressure<a href="#shared-connection-pool-to-reduce-database-pressure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Shared connection pool to reduce database pressure的直接链接" title="Shared connection pool to reduce database pressure的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>At present, the underlying operating tools and data synchronization tools provided by computing engines such as Spark/Flink cannot solve the problem that each table needs a JDBC connection when the entire database is synchronized. Database connections are resources for the database. Too many database connections will put great pressure on the database, resulting in a decrease in the stability of database read and write delays. This is a very serious accident for business databases. To solve this problem, SeaTunnel Engine uses a shared connection pool to ensure that multiple tables can share JDBC connections, thereby reducing the use of database connections.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="breakpoint-resume-incrementalfull-volume">Breakpoint resume (incremental/full volume)<a href="#breakpoint-resume-incrementalfull-volume" class="hash-link" aria-label="Breakpoint resume (incremental/full volume)的直接链接" title="Breakpoint resume (incremental/full volume)的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>SeaTunnel Engine supports resumed uploads under offline synchronization. When the amount of data is large, a data synchronization job often needs to run for tens of minutes or several hours. If the middle job hangs up and reruns, it means wasting time. SeaTunnel Engine will continue to save the state (checkpoint) during the offline synchronization process. When the job hangs up and reruns, it will continue to run from the last checkpoint, which effectively solves the data that may be caused by hardware problems such as node downtime. Delay.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-schema-revolution-route">The Schema revolution route<a href="#the-schema-revolution-route" class="hash-link" aria-label="The Schema revolution route的直接链接" title="The Schema revolution route的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Schema evolution is a feature that allows users to easily change a table&#x27;s current schema to accommodate data that changes over time. Most commonly, it is used when performing an append or overwrite operation, to automatically adjust the schema to include one or more new columns.</p><p>This capability is required in real-time data warehouse scenarios.

If a task fails, the entire job will be rolled back and restarted. The design of SeaTunnel Engine takes into account that in the data synchronization scenario, in many q cases, the failure of a task should only need to focus on fault tolerance for tasks that have upstream and downstream relationships with it. Based on this design principle, SeaTunnel Engine will first generate a logical DAG according to the user-configured job configuration file, then optimize the logical DAG, and finally generate a pipeline (a connected subgraph in a job DAG) to call and execute jobs at the granularity. fault tolerance.</p><p>A typical usage scenario is:</p><p>Use the CDC connector to read data from MySQL&#x27;s binlog and write it to another MySQL. If you use Flink or Spark engine, once the target MySQL cannot write, it will cause the task of CDC to read the binlog to be terminated. If MySQL is set If the expiration time of the log is set, the problem of the target MySQL is solved, but the log of the source MySQL is cleared, which leads to data loss and other problems.</p><p>SeaTunnel Engine will automatically optimize this synchronization task, automatically add the source to the target Cache, and then further optimize this job into two Pipelines, pipeline#1 is responsible for reading data from the CDC and writing it to the SeaTunnel Cache, and pipeline#2 is responsible for reading data from the SeaTunnel Cache Cache reads data and writes to target MySQL. If there is a problem with the target MySQL and cannot be written, the pipeline#2 of this synchronization job will be terminated, and the pipeline#1 will still run normally. This design fundamentally solves the above problems and is more in line with the processing logic of the data synchronization engine.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dynamically-share-threads-to-reduce-resource-usage">Dynamically share threads to reduce resource usage<a href="#dynamically-share-threads-to-reduce-resource-usage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Dynamically share threads to reduce resource usage的直接链接" title="Dynamically share threads to reduce resource usage的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>SeaTunnel Engine&#x27;s Task design uses shared thread technology. Different from Flink/Spark, SeaTunnel Engine does not simply allow a Task to occupy a thread, but through a dynamic perception method - Dynamic Thread Sharing (Dynamic Thread Sharing) To judge whether a Task should share a thread with other Tasks or should monopolize a thread.</p><p>Compared with single-threaded serial computing, multi-threaded parallel computing has better performance advantages, but if each Task uses an independent thread to run, when there are many tables for data synchronization and the number of Tasks is large, it will be in the Worker node Start very many threads on it. When the number of CPU cores is fixed, the more threads, the better. When the number of threads is too large, the CPU needs to spend a lot of time on thread context switching, which will affect computing performance.</p><p>Flink/Spark usually limits the maximum number of tasks running on each node. In this way, it can avoid starting too many threads. To run more tasks on one node, SeaTunnel Engine can share thread technology. Let those tasks with a small amount of data share threads, and tasks with a large amount of data exclusively use threads. This method makes it possible for SeaTunnel Engine to run hundreds or thousands of table synchronization tasks on one node, with less resource occupation. Complete the synchronization of more tables.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="05-basic-functions-and-features">05 Basic functions and features<a href="#05-basic-functions-and-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="05 Basic functions and features的直接链接" title="05 Basic functions and features的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>2.3.0 is the first official version of SeaTunnel Engine, which implements some basic functions.

The left-hand side briefly lists the Source scenarios, for example, we abstract the Source’s API, Type, and State, to read the data source, unifying the data types of the various data sources to the abstract type defined in it, and some state recovery and retention of the read location during the reading process.</p><p>This is an abstraction for Source, and we have done a similar abstraction for Sink, i.e. how data is written, and how the data type matches the real data source type, and how the state is restored and retained.</p><p>Based on these APIs, we will have a translation layer to translate these APIs to the corresponding execution engine. SeaTunnel currently supports three execution engines, Spark, Flink, and our own execution engine, SeaTunnel Engine, which will be released soon.</p><p>This is roughly what SeaTunnel does, SeaTunnel relies on Source and Sink to read and write data for data synchronization, we call them Connectors. The Connector consists of a Source and a Sink.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/zh-CN/assets/images/16714316928812-337c3d4770094c09ae55a5312670d87f.jpg" width="720" height="758" class="img_ev3q">

Firstly, there are the typical usage scenarios supported by Source, such as bulk reading of devices, field projection, data type mapping, parallel reading, etc.</p><p>As you can see above, IoTDB supports all features except once, exactly once and stream mode, such as batch reads, IoTDB has a SQL syntax similar to group by device, which allows you to read data from multiple devices in a single batch. For basic data type projection, the SQL in IoTDB will take time by default when looking up any metric, or group by the device will take the device column, and we also support projection onto SeaTunnel columns by default.</p><p>The only data type not supported is Victor, all others are supported.</p><p>For the parallel read piece, the IoTDB data is actually timestamped and we use timestamped ranges to achieve parallel reads.</p><p>The recovery of the state, since we have divided the time range read into different splits, can be done based on the Split location information.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sink-functional-features">Sink functional features<a href="#sink-functional-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Sink functional features的直接链接" title="Sink functional features的直接链接">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/zh-CN/assets/images/16714317679569-a1923e70d93e6204c42aa7531a96a024.jpg" width="720" height="372" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The diagram above shows the features already supported by SeaTunnel.

The SQL extraction of column codes allows you to extract only some of the columns you need, and when used on SeaTunnel, you can specify the name, type, etc. of the column after it is mapped to SeaTunnel via fields.

Assuming there is a table in IoTDB, we project the device column onto SeaTunnel by making it data as well through syntax.

For sink failure, when data cannot be written, a possible solution is to work two jobs at the same time.</p><p>One job reads the database logs using the CDC source connector and then writes the data to Kafka using the Kafka Sink connector. Another job reads data from Kafka using the Kafka source connector and writes data to the destination using the destination sink connector.</p><p>This solution requires users to have a deep understanding of the underlying technology, and both tasks will increase the difficulty of operation and maintenance.

To address the pain points mentioned above, we actively explored solutions and conducted a selection analysis of several mainstream data integration products in the industry. As you can see from the comparison above, Datax and SeaTunnel both offer good scalability, and high stability, support rich connector plugins, provide scripted, uniformly configurable usage, and have active communities.</li></ul><p>However, Datax is limited by being distributed and is not well suited to massive data scenarios.</p><p>In contrast, SeaTunnel offers the ability to provide distributed execution, distributed transactions, scalable levels of data handling, and the ability to provide a unified technical solution in data synchronization scenarios.</p><p>In addition to the advantages and features described above and the applicable scenarios, more importantly, the current offline computing resources for big data are unified and managed by yarn, and for the subsequently extended tasks we also wish to execute on Yarn, we finally prefer SeaTunnel for our usage scenarios.</p><p>Further performance testing of SeaTunnel and the development of an open data scheduling platform to integrate SeaTunnel may be carried out at a later stage, and its use will be rolled out gradually.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="outbound-scenario-hive-data-sync-to-starrocks">Outbound scenario: Hive data sync to StarRocks<a href="#outbound-scenario-hive-data-sync-to-starrocks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Outbound scenario: Hive data sync to StarRocks的直接链接" title="Outbound scenario: Hive data sync to StarRocks的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>To briefly introduce the background, the Big Data platform has now completed the unification of the OLAP engine layer, using the StarRocks engine to replace the previous Kylin engine as the main query engine in OLAP scenarios.</p><p>In the data processing process, after the data is modelled in the data warehouse, the upper model needs to be imported into the OLAP engine for query acceleration, so there are a lot of tasks to push data from Hive to StarRocks every day. task (based on a wrapper for the StarRocks Broker Load import method) to a StarRocks-based table.</p><p>The current pain points are twofold.</p><p>·Long data synchronization links: Hive2StarRocks processing links, which require at least two tasks, are relatively redundant.</p><p>·Outbound efficiency: From the perspective of outbound efficiency, many Hive models themselves are processed by Spark SQL, and based on the processing the Spark Dataset in memory can be pushed directly to StarRocks without dropping the disk, improving the model’s regional time.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/zh-CN/assets/images/16714327218590-2644dc4ad1179eab81d40fc774d970e9.jpg" width="720" height="405" class="img_ev3q">

It is important to be familiar with source compilation, as local source compilation can prove that the code added to a project can be compiled, and can be used as a preliminary check before committing to pr. Source compilation is generally slow and can be speeded up by using mvn -T for multi-threaded parallel compilation.</li><li>Compilation checks
Pre-compilation checks, including Licence header, Code checkstyle, and Document checkstyle, will be checked during Maven compilation, and if they fail, the CI will not be passed. So it is recommended to use some plug-in tools in the idea to improve the efficiency, such as Code checkstyle has a plug-in to automatically check the code specification, Licence header can add code templates in the idea, these have been shared by the community before how to do!</li><li>Add full E2E</li></ul><p>Add full E2E testing and ensure that the E2E is passed before the Pull request.</p><p>Finally, I hope more students will join the SeaTunnel community, where you can not only feel the open-source spirit and culture of Apache but also understand the management process of Apache projects and learn good code design ideas.</p><p>We hope that by working together and growing together, we can build SeaTunnel into a top-notch data integration platform.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>标签：</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zh-CN/blog/tags/meetup">Meetup</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="description" content="SeaTunnel Connector Acess Plan"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy" itemprop="headline"><a itemprop="url" href="/zh-CN/blog/2022/09/20/A-tutorial-to-help-you develop-a-SeaTunnel-Connector-hand-by-hand-while-avoiding -pitfalls">A tutorial to help you develop a SeaTunnel Connector hand-by-hand while avoiding pitfalls</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2022-09-20T00:00:00.000Z" itemprop="datePublished">2022年9月20日</time> · <!-- -->阅读需 13 分钟</div></header><div class="markdown" itemprop="articleBody"><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*4fOZaPYhwL2pdUpK" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="seatunnel-connector-acess-plan">SeaTunnel Connector Acess Plan<a href="#seatunnel-connector-acess-plan" class="hash-link" aria-label="SeaTunnel Connector Acess Plan的直接链接" title="SeaTunnel Connector Acess Plan的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>During the recent live event of the SeaTunnel Connector Access Plan, Beluga open source engineer Wang Hailin shared the “SeaTunnel Connector Access Plan and Development Guide to Avoiding Pit,” and taught everyone how to develop a connector from scratch, including the whole process — from preparation to testing, and final PR.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="speaker">Speaker<a href="#speaker" class="hash-link" aria-label="Speaker的直接链接" title="Speaker的直接链接">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1100/0*LRtFiJkgV5DEWOAa" class="img_ev3q">

Is support still required?</p><p>Use the Source#getBoundedness interface to mark the modes supported by the source.</p><p>For example, Kafka naturally supports streaming reading, but it can also support batch mode reading by obtaining lastOffset in the source.</p><p>Another question to be aware of: does the source require concurrent reads? If it is single concurrency, after the source is started, a reader will be created to read the data from the data source.</p><p>If you want to achieve multi-concurrency, you need to implement an enumerator interface through which data blocks are allocated to readers, and the readers each read their allocated data blocks.</p><p>For example, the Kafka source uses partition sharding, and the jdbc source uses fields for range query sharding. It should be noted here that if it is a concurrent reading method, the stability of the data block distribution rules must be ensured.</p><p>This is because currently, the connector has a corresponding enumerator on each shard in actual operation, and it is necessary to ensure that the enumerator has data in each shard.</p><p>Thirdly, does the source need to support resumable transfer/state restoration?</p><p>If you want to support this, you need to implement:</p><ul><li><strong>Source#restoreEnumerator</strong>: restore state</li><li><strong>Enumerator#snapshotState</strong>: storage shard allocation</li><li><strong>Reader#snapshotState</strong>: stores the read position</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="02-sink-related-development">02.

To elaborate, let’s dive in and check out how we can implement a source and the core interfaces that need to be implemented to access the Source.</p><p>The simplest Source is a single concurrent Source. However, if a source does not support state storage and other advanced functions, what interfaces should we implement in these simple single concurrent sources?</p><p>Firstly, we need to use getBoundedness in the Source to identify whether the Source supports real-time or offline, or both.</p><p>createReader creates a Reader whose main function is to read the specific implementation of data. A single concurrent source is really simple as we only need to implement one method, pollNext, through which the read data is sent.</p><p>If concurrent reading is required, what additional interfaces should we implement?
<img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/393/1*bRxRjyMOGkVqseQkg0ONWg.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>For concurrent reading, we’ll introduce a new member, called the Enumerator.</p><p>We implement createEnumerator in Source, and the main function of this member is to create an Enumerator to split the task into segments and then send it to the Reader.</p><p>For example, a task can be divided into 4 splits.</p><p>If it is concurrent twice, it’ll correspond to two Readers. Two of the four splits will be sent to Reader1, and the other two will be sent to Reader2.</p><p>If the number of concurrencies is more — for example, let’s say there are four concurrences, then you have to create four Readers. You have to use the corresponding four splits for concurrent reading for improved efficiency.</p><p>A corresponding interface in the Enumerator called the addSplitsBack sends the splits to the corresponding Reader. Through this method, the ID of the Reader can be specified.</p><p>Similarly, there is an interface called the addSplits in the Reader to receive the splits sent by the Enumerator for data reading.</p><p>In a nutshell, for concurrent reading, we need an Enumerator to implement task splitting and send the splits to the reader. Also, the reader receives the splits and uses them for reading.</p><p>In addition, if we need to support resuming and exactly-once semantics, what additional interfaces should we implement?</p><p>If the goal is to resume the transfer from a breakpoint, we must save the state and restore it. For this, we need to implement a restoreEnumerator in Source.</p><p>The restoreEnumerator method is used to restore an Enumerator through the state and restore the split.</p><p>Correspondingly, we need to implement a snapshotState in this enumerator, which is used to save the state of the current Enumerator and perform failure recovery during checkpoints.</p><p>At the same time, the Reader will also have a snapshotState method to save the split state of the Reader.</p><p>In the event of a failed restart, the Enumerator can be restored through the saved state. After the split is restored, reading can be continued from the place of failure, including fetching and incoming data.</p><p>The exact one-time semantics actually requires the source to support data replays, such as Kafka, Pulsar, and others. In addition, the sink must be submitted in two phases, i.e., the precise one-time semantics can be achieved with the cooperation of these two sources and sinks.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-access-sink">How to access Sink<a href="#how-to-access-sink" class="hash-link" aria-label="How to access Sink的直接链接" title="How to access Sink的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>Now, let’s take a look at how to connect to the Sink. What interfaces does the Sink need to implement?</p><p>Truth be told, Sink is relatively simple. For concurrent sinks, when state storage and two-phase commit are not supported, the Sink is simple.</p><p>To elaborate, the Sink does not distinguish between stream synchronization and batch synchronization as the Sink — and the entire SeaTunnel API system — supports <strong>Unified Stream and Batch Processing.</strong></p><p>Firstly, we need to implement createWriter. A Writer is used for data writing.</p><p>You need to implement a writer method in Writer through which data is written to the target library.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/414/1*xQ7DRHdBGv-ofjSYdSHAoA.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>As shown in the figure above, if two concurrencies are set, the engine will call the createWriter method twice in order to generate two Writers. The engine will feed data to these two writers, which will write the data to the target through the write method.</p><p>For a more advanced setup, for example, we need to support <strong>two-phase commit and state storage</strong>.</p><p>Here, what additional interfaces should we implement?</p><p>First, let’s introduce a new member, the Committer, whose main role is for the second-stage commit.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/414/1*cvj1i2A-E-1c_bCZneshtg.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Since Sink is stored in state, it is necessary to restore Writer through the state. Hence, restoreWriter should be implemented.</p><p>Also, since we have introduced a new member, the Committer, we should also implement a createCommitter in the sink. We can then use this method to create a Committer for the second-stage commit or rollback.</p><p>In this case, what additional interfaces does Writer need to implement?</p><p>Since it is a two-phase commit, the first-phase commit is done in the Writer through the implementation of the prepareCommit method — which is mainly used for the first-phase commit.</p><p>In addition, state storage and failure recovery is also supported, meaning we need snapshotState to take snapshots at checkpoints. This saves the state for failure recovery scenarios.</p><p>The Committer is the core here. It is mainly used for rollback and commit operations in the second phase.</p><p>For the corresponding process, we need to write data to the database. Here, the engine will trigger the first stage commit during the checkpoint, and then the Writer needs to prepare a commit.</p><p>At the same time, it will return commitInfo to the engine, and the engine will judge whether the first stage commits of all writers are successful.</p><p>If they are indeed successful, the engine will use the commit method to actually commit.</p><p>For MySQL, the first-stage commit just saves a transaction ID and sends it to the commit. The engine determines whether the transaction ID is committed or rolled back.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to-implement-the-connector">How to implement the Connector<a href="#how-to-implement-the-connector" class="hash-link" aria-label="How to implement the Connector的直接链接" title="How to implement the Connector的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>We’ve taken a look at Source and Sink; let’s now look at how to access the data source and implement your own Connector.</p><p>Firstly, we need to build a development environment for the Connector.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-necessary-environment">The necessary environment<a href="#the-necessary-environment" class="hash-link" aria-label="The necessary environment的直接链接" title="The necessary environment的直接链接">​</a></h3><ol><li><p>Java 1.8\11, Maven, IntelliJ IDEA</p></li><li><p>Windows users need to additionally download gitbash (<a href="https://gitforwindows.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://gitforwindows.org/</a>)</p></li><li><p>Once you have these, you can download the SeaTunnel source code by cloning the git.</p></li><li><p>Download SeaTunnel source code 1, git clone <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-seatunnel.git2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/apache/incubator-seatunnel.git2</a>, cd incubator-seatunnel</p></li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="seatunnel-engineering-structure">SeaTunnel Engineering Structure<a href="#seatunnel-engineering-structure" class="hash-link" aria-label="SeaTunnel Engineering Structure的直接链接" title="SeaTunnel Engineering Structure的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>We then open it again through the IDE, and see the directory structure as shown in the figure:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*utRhNAsYiqQqBFa4Tjewgw.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The directory is divided into several parts:</p><ol><li>Connector — v2</li></ol><p>Specific implementation of the new Connector(Connector — v2) will be placed in this module.</p><ol start="2"><li>connector-v2-dist</li></ol><p>The translation layer of the new connector translates into specific engine implementation — instead of implementing under corresponding engines such as Spark, Flink, and ST-Engine.

In fact, the implementations of Connectors like Feishu, DingTalk, and Facebook messenger are quite simple as the connectors do not need to carry a large amount of data (just a simple Source and Sink). This is in sharp contrast to Hive and other databases that need to consider transaction consistency or concurrency issues.</p><p>We welcome everyone to make contributions and join our Apache SeaTunnel family!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="about-seatunnel">About SeaTunnel<a href="#about-seatunnel" class="hash-link" aria-label="About SeaTunnel的直接链接" title="About SeaTunnel的直接链接">​</a></h2><p>SeaTunnel (formerly Waterdrop) is an easy-to-use, ultra-high-performance distributed data integration platform that supports the real-time synchronization of massive amounts of data and can synchronize hundreds of billions of data per day stably and efficiently.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-do-we-need-seatunnel">Why do we need SeaTunnel?<a href="#why-do-we-need-seatunnel" class="hash-link" aria-label="Why do we need SeaTunnel?的直接链接" title="Why do we need SeaTunnel?的直接链接">​</a></h3><p>SeaTunnel does everything it can to solve the problems you may encounter in synchronizing massive amounts of data.</p><ul><li>Data loss and duplication</li><li>Task buildup and latency</li><li>Low throughput</li><li>Long application-to-production cycle time</li><li>Lack of application status monitoring</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="seatunnel-usage-scenarios">SeaTunnel Usage Scenarios<a href="#seatunnel-usage-scenarios" class="hash-link" aria-label="SeaTunnel Usage Scenarios的直接链接" title="SeaTunnel Usage Scenarios的直接链接">​</a></h3><ul><li>Massive data synchronization</li><li>Massive data integration</li><li>ETL of large volumes of data</li><li>Massive data aggregation</li><li>Multi-source data processing</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="features-of-seatunnel">Features of SeaTunnel<a href="#features-of-seatunnel" class="hash-link" aria-label="Features of SeaTunnel的直接链接" title="Features of SeaTunnel的直接链接">​</a></h3><ul><li>Rich components</li><li>High scalability</li><li>Easy to use</li><li>Mature and stable</li></ul></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl" itemprop="blogPost" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><meta itemprop="description" content="As SeaTunnel gets popular around the world, it is attracting more and more contributors from overseas to join the open-source career.
