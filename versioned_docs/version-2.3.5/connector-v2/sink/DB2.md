# DB2

> JDBC DB2 Sink Connector

## Support Those Engines

> Spark<br/>
> Flink<br/>
> SeaTunnel Zeta<br/>

## Description

Write data through jdbc. Support Batch mode and Streaming mode, support concurrent writing, support exactly-once
semantics (using XA transaction guarantee).

## Using Dependency

### For Spark/Flink Engine

> 1. You need to ensure that the [jdbc driver jar package](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.ibm.db2.jcc/db2jcc) has been placed in directory `${SEATUNNEL_HOME}/plugins/`.

### For SeaTunnel Zeta Engine

> 1. You need to ensure that the [jdbc driver jar package](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.ibm.db2.jcc/db2jcc) has been placed in directory `${SEATUNNEL_HOME}/lib/`.

## Key Features

- [x] [exactly-once](../../concept/connector-v2-features.md)
- [ ] [cdc](../../concept/connector-v2-features.md)

> Use `Xa transactions` to ensure `exactly-once`. So only support `exactly-once` for the database which is
> support `Xa transactions`. You can set `is_exactly_once=true` to enable it.

### Tips

> If partition_column is not set, it will run in single concurrency, and if partition_column is set, it will be executed  in parallel according to the concurrency of tasks.

## Task Example

### Simple:

> This example defines a SeaTunnel synchronization task that automatically generates data through FakeSource and sends it to JDBC Sink. FakeSource generates a total of 16 rows of data (row.num=16), with each row having two fields, name (string type) and age (int type). The final target table is test_table will also be 16 rows of data in the table. Before run this job, you need create database test and table test_table in your DB2. And if you have not yet installed and deployed SeaTunnel, you need to follow the instructions in [Install SeaTunnel](../../start-v2/locally/deployment.md) to install and deploy SeaTunnel. And then follow the instructions in [Quick Start With SeaTunnel Engine](../../start-v2/locally/quick-start-seatunnel-engine.md) to run this job.

```
# Defining the runtime environment
env {
  parallelism = 1
  job.mode = "BATCH"
}

source {
  # This is a example source plugin **only for test and demonstrate the feature source plugin**
  FakeSource {
    parallelism = 1
    result_table_name = "fake"
    row.num = 16
    schema = {
      fields {
        name = "string"
        age = "int"
      }
    }
  }
  # If you would like to get more information about how to configure seatunnel and see full list of source plugins,
  # please go to https://seatunnel.apache.org/docs/category/source-v2
}

transform {
  # If you would like to get more information about how to configure seatunnel and see full list of transform plugins,
    # please go to https://seatunnel.apache.org/docs/category/transform-v2
}

sink {
    jdbc {
        url = "jdbc:db2://127.0.0.1:50000/dbname"
        driver = "com.ibm.db2.jdbc.app.DB2Driver"
        user = "root"
        password = "123456"
        query = "insert into test_table(name,age) values(?,?)"
        }
  # If you would like to get more information about how to configure seatunnel and see full list of sink plugins,
  # please go to https://seatunnel.apache.org/docs/category/sink-v2
}
```

### Generate Sink SQL

> This example  not need to write complex sql statements, you can configure the database name table name to automatically generate add statements for you

```
sink {
    jdbc {
        url = "jdbc:db2://127.0.0.1:50000/dbname"
        driver = "com.ibm.db2.jdbc.app.DB2Driver"
        user = "root"
        password = "123456"
        # Automatically generate sql statements based on database table names
        generate_sink_sql = true
        database = test
        table = test_table
    }
}
```

### Exactly-once :

> For accurate write scene we guarantee accurate once

```
sink {
    jdbc {
        url = "jdbc:db2://127.0.0.1:50000/dbname"
        driver = "com.ibm.db2.jdbc.app.DB2Driver"
    
        max_retries = 0
        user = "root"
        password = "123456"
        query = "insert into test_table(name,age) values(?,?)"
    
        is_exactly_once = "true"
    
        xa_data_source_class_name = "com.db2.cj.jdbc.Db2XADataSource"
    }
}
```
