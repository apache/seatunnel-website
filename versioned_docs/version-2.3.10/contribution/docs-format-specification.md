## Admonitions

We have special admonitions syntax by wrapping text with a set of 3 colons, followed by a label denoting its type. When you want to emphasize the content, it is recommended to use admonitions.

In use, the following specifications need to be followed:

- Tip: mainly used for operational  tips and tricks.

- Note: used for more details and explanations.

- Caution: used for warnings and precautions.

You may also specify an optional title. Here are the examples of admonitions syntax:

```Markdown
:::tip Tip
Some content with tips
:::

:::info Note
Some content with explanations
:::

:::caution Warning
Some content with precuations and warnings
:::
```
