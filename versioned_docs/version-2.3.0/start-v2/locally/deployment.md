# Deployment

## Step 1: Prepare the environment

Before you getting start the local run, you need to make sure you already have installed the following software which SeaTunnel required:

* [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) (Java 8 or 11, other versions greater than Java 8 can theoretically work as well) installed and `JAVA_HOME` set.

## Step 2: Download SeaTunnel

Enter the [seatunnel download page](https://seatunnel.apache.org/download) and download the latest version of distribute
package `seatunnel-<version>-bin.tar.gz`

Or you can download it by terminal

```shell
export version="2.3.0-beta"
wget "https://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/seatunnel/${version}/apache-seatunnel-incubating-${version}-bin.tar.gz"
tar -xzvf "apache-seatunnel-incubating-${version}-bin.tar.gz"
```
<!-- TODO: We should add example module as quick start which is no need for install Spark or Flink -->

## Step 3: Install connectors plugin
Since 2.2.0-beta, the binary package does not provide connector dependencies by default, so when using it for the first time, we need to execute the following command to install the connector: (Of course, you can also manually download the connector from [Apache Maven Repository](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/seatunnel/ to download, then manually move to the seatunnel subdirectory under the connectors directory).
```bash
sh bin/install_plugin.sh 2.3.0-beta
```
If you need to specify the version of the connector, take 2.3.0-beta as an example, we need to execute
```bash
sh bin/install_plugin.sh 2.3.0-beta
```
Usually we don't need all the connector plugins, so you can specify the plugins you need by configuring `config/plugin_config`, for example, you only need the `connector-console` plugin, then you can modify plugin.properties as
```plugin_config
--seatunnel-connectors--
connector-console
--end--
```
If we want our sample application to work properly, we need to add the following plugins

```plugin_config
--seatunnel-connectors--
connector-fake
connector-console
--end--
```

You can find all supported connectors and corresponding plugin_config configuration names under `${SEATUNNEL_HOME}/connectors/plugins-mapping.properties`.

:::tip

If you want to install the connector plugin by manually downloading the connector, you need to pay special attention to the following

The connectors directory contains the following subdirectories, if they do not exist, you need to create them manually

```
flink
flink-sql
seatunnel
spark
```

If you want to install the V2 connector plugin manually, you only need to download the V2 connector plugin you need and put them in the seatunnel directory

## What's More

For now, you are already deployment SeaTunnel complete. You can follow [Quick Start](quick-start-seatunnel-engine.md) to configure and run a data synchronization job.
