# Quick Start With Flink

## Step 1: Deployment SeaTunnel And Connectors

Before starting, make sure you have downloaded and deployed SeaTunnel as described in [deployment](deployment.md)

## Step 2: Deployment And Config Flink

Please [download Flink](https://flink.apache.org/downloads.html) first(**required version >= 1.12.0 and version < 1.14.x **). For more information you could see [Getting Started: standalone](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.14/docs/deployment/resource-providers/standalone/overview/)

**Configure SeaTunnel**: Change the setting in `config/seatunnel-env.sh`, it is base on the path your engine install at [deployment](deployment.md).
Change `FLINK_HOME` to the Flink deployment dir.


## Step 3: Add Job Config File to define a job

Edit `config/seatunnel.streaming.conf.template`, which determines the way and logic of data input, processing, and output after seatunnel is started.
The following is an example of the configuration file, which is the same as the example application mentioned above.

```hocon
env {
  execution.parallelism = 1
  job.mode = "BATCH"
}

source {
    FakeSource {
      result_table_name = "fake"
      row.num = 16
      schema = {
        fields {
          name = "string"
          age = "int"
        }
      }
    }
}

transform {

}

sink {
  Console {}
}

```

More information about config please check [config concept](../../concept/config.md)

## Step 3: Run SeaTunnel Application

You could start the application by the following commands

```shell
cd "apache-seatunnel-incubating-${version}"
./bin/start-seatunnel-flink-connector-v2.sh --config ./config/seatunnel.streaming.conf.template

```

**See The Output**: When you run the command, you could see its output in your console. You can think this
is a sign that the command ran successfully or not.

The SeaTunnel console will prints some logs as below:

```shell
fields : name, age
types : STRING, INT
row=1 : elWaB, 1984352560
row=2 : uAtnp, 762961563

## What's More

For now, you are already take a quick look about SeaTunnel with Flink, you could see [connector](/docs/category/connector-v2) to find all
source and sink SeaTunnel supported. Or see [SeaTunnel With Flink](../../other-engine/flink.md) if you want to know more about SeaTunnel Run With Flink.

SeaTunnel have an own engine named SeaTunnel Engine and SeaTunnel Engine is the default engine of SeaTunnel. You can follow [Quick Start](quick-start-seatunnel-engine.md) to configure and run a data synchronization job.
