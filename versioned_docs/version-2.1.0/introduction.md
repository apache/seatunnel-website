SeaTunnel was formerly named Waterdrop , and renamed SeaTunnel since October 12, 2021.

SeaTunnel is a very easy-to-use ultra-high-performance distributed data integration platform that supports real-time
synchronization of massive data. It can synchronize tens of billions of data stably and efficiently every day, and has
been used in the production of nearly 100 companies.

## Why do we need SeaTunnel

SeaTunnel will do its best to solve the problems that may be encountered in the synchronization of massive data:

- Data loss and duplication
- Task accumulation and delay
- Low throughput
- Long cycle to be applied in the production environment
- Lack of application running status monitoring

## SeaTunnel use scenarios

- Mass data synchronization
- Mass data integration
- ETL with massive data
- Mass data aggregation
- Multi-source data processing

## Features of SeaTunnel

- Easy to use, flexible configuration, low code development
- Real-time streaming
- Offline multi-source data analysis
- High-performance, massive data processing capabilities
- Modular and plug-in mechanism, easy to extend
- Support data processing and aggregation by SQL
- Support Spark structured streaming
- Support Spark 2.x

## Workflow of SeaTunnel

![seatunnel-workflow.svg](images/image/seatunnel-workflow.svg)

```
Source[Data Source Input] -> Transform[Data Processing] -> Sink[Result Output]
```

The data processing pipeline is constituted by multiple filters to meet a variety of data processing needs. If you are
accustomed to SQL, you can also directly construct a data processing pipeline by SQL, which is simple and efficient.
Currently, the filter list supported by SeaTunnel is still being expanded. Furthermore, you can develop your own data
processing plug-in, because the whole system is easy to expand.

## Plugins supported by SeaTunnel

- Input plugin Fake, File, Hdfs, Kafka, Druid, InfluxDB, S3, Socket, self-developed Input plugin

- Filter plugin Add, Checksum, Convert, Date, Drop, Grok, Json, Kv, Lowercase, Remove, Rename, Repartition, Replace,
  Sample, Split, Sql, Table, Truncate, Uppercase, Uuid, Self-developed Filter plugin

- Output plugin Elasticsearch, File, Hdfs, Jdbc, Kafka, Druid, InfluxDB, Mysql, S3, Stdout, self-developed Output plugin

## Environmental dependency

1. java runtime environment, java >= 8

2. If you want to run SeaTunnel in a cluster environment, any of the following Spark cluster environments is usable:

- Spark on Yarn
- Spark Standalone

If the data volume is small, or the goal is merely for functional verification, you can also start in local mode without
a cluster environment, because SeaTunnel supports standalone operation. Note: SeaTunnel 2.0 supports running on Spark
and Flink.

## Application practice cases

- Weibo, Value-added Business Department Data Platform

Weibo business uses an internal customized version of SeaTunnel and its sub-project Guardian for SeaTunnel On Yarn task
monitoring for hundreds of real-time streaming computing tasks.

- Sina, Big Data Operation Analysis Platform

Sina Data Operation Analysis Platform uses SeaTunnel to perform real-time and offline analysis of data operation and
maintenance for Sina News, CDN and other services, and write it into Clickhouse.

- Sogou, Sogou Qiqian System

Sogou Qiqian System takes SeaTunnel as an ETL tool to help establish a real-time data warehouse system.

- Qutoutiao, Qutoutiao Data Center

Qutoutiao Data Center uses SeaTunnel to support mysql to hive offline ETL tasks, real-time hive to clickhouse backfill
technical support, and well covers most offline and real-time tasks needs.

- Yixia Technology, Yizhibo Data Platform

- Yonghui Superstores Founders' Alliance-Yonghui Yunchuang Technology, Member E-commerce Data Analysis Platform

SeaTunnel provides real-time streaming and offline SQL computing of e-commerce user behavior data for Yonghui Life, a
new retail brand of Yonghui Yunchuang Technology.

- Shuidichou, Data Platform

Shuidichou adopts SeaTunnel to do real-time streaming and regular offline batch processing on Yarn, processing 3~4T data
volume average daily, and later writing the data to Clickhouse.

- Tencent Cloud

Collecting various logs from business services into Apache Kafka, some of the data in Apache Kafka is consumed and extracted through Seatunnel, and then store into Clickhouse.
