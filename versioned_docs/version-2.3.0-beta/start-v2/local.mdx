# Set Up with Locally

> Let's take an application that randomly generates data in memory, processes it through SQL, and finally outputs it to the console as an example.

## Step 1: Prepare the environment

Before you getting start the local run, you need to make sure you already have installed the following software which SeaTunnel required:

* [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) (Java 8 or 11, other versions greater than Java 8 can theoretically work as well) installed and `JAVA_HOME` set.
* Download the engine, you can choose and download one of them from below as your favour, you could see more information about [why we need engine in SeaTunnel](../faq.md#why-i-should-install-computing-engine-like-spark-or-flink)
* Spark: Please [download Spark](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html) first(**required version >= 2 and version < 3.x **). For more information you could
see [Getting Started: standalone](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/spark-standalone.html#installing-spark-standalone-to-a-cluster)
* Flink: Please [download Flink](https://flink.apache.org/downloads.html) first(**required version >= 1.12.0 and version < 1.14.x **). For more information you could see [Getting Started: standalone](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.14/docs/deployment/resource-providers/standalone/overview/)

## Step 2: Download SeaTunnel

Enter the [seatunnel download page](https://seatunnel.apache.org/download) and download the latest version of distribute
package `seatunnel-<version>-bin.tar.gz`

Or you can download it by terminal

```shell
export version="2.3.0-beta"
wget "https://archive.apache.org/dist/incubator/seatunnel/${version}/apache-seatunnel-incubating-${version}-bin.tar.gz"
tar -xzvf "apache-seatunnel-incubating-${version}-bin.tar.gz"
```
<!-- TODO: We should add example module as quick start which is no need for install Spark or Flink -->

## Step 3: Install connectors plugin
Since 2.2.0-beta, the binary package does not provide connector dependencies by default, so when using it for the first time, we need to execute the following command to install the connector: (Of course, you can also manually download the connector from [Apache Maven Repository](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/seatunnel/ to download, then manually move to the seatunnel subdirectory under the connectors directory).
```bash
sh bin/install_plugin.sh 2.3.0-beta
```
If you need to specify the version of the connector, take 2.2.0-beta as an example, we need to execute
```bash
sh bin/install_plugin.sh 2.2.0-beta
```
Usually we don't need all the connector plugins, so you can specify the plugins you need by configuring `config/plugin_config`, for example, you only need the `connector-console` plugin, then you can modify plugin.properties as
```plugin_config
--seatunnel-connectors--
connector-console
--end--
```
If we want our sample application to work properly, we need to add the following plugins

```plugin_config
--seatunnel-connectors--
connector-fake
connector-console
--end--
```

You can find all supported connectors and corresponding plugin_config configuration names under `${SEATUNNEL_HOME}/connectors/plugins-mapping.properties`.

:::tip

If you want to install the connector plugin by manually downloading the connector, you need to pay special attention to the following
:::

The connectors directory contains the following subdirectories, if they do not exist, you need to create them manually

```
flink
flink-sql
seatunnel
spark
```

If you want to install the V2 connector plugin manually, you only need to download the V2 connector plugin you need and put them in the seatunnel directory


## Step 4: Configure SeaTunnel Application

### Spark or Flink

**Configure SeaTunnel**: Change the setting in `config/seatunnel-env.sh`, it is base on the path your engine install at [prepare step two](#prepare).
Change `SPARK_HOME` if you using Spark as your engine, or change `FLINK_HOME` if you're using Flink.

### SeaTunnel Engine

SeaTunnel Engine is the default engine for SeaTunnel, You do not need to do other additional configuration operations.

### Add Job Config File to define a job

Edit `config/seatunnel.streaming.conf.template`, which determines the way and logic of data input, processing, and output after seatunnel is started.
The following is an example of the configuration file, which is the same as the example application mentioned above.

```hocon
env {
  execution.parallelism = 1
  job.mode = "BATCH"
}

source {
    FakeSource {
      result_table_name = "fake"
      row.num = 16
      schema = {
        fields {
          name = "string"
          age = "int"
        }
      }
    }
}

transform {

}

sink {
  Console {}
}

```

More information about config please check [config concept](../concept/config)

## Step 5: Run SeaTunnel Application

You could start the application by the following commands

<Tabs
  groupId="engine-type"
  defaultValue="spark"
  values={[
    {label: 'Spark', value: 'spark'},
    {label: 'Flink', value: 'flink'},
    {label: 'SeaTunnel Engine', value: 'SeaTunnel Engine'},
  ]}>
<TabItem value="spark">

```shell
cd "apache-seatunnel-incubating-${version}"
./bin/start-seatunnel-spark-connector-v2.sh \
--master local[4] \
--deploy-mode client \
--config ./config/seatunnel.streaming.conf.template
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="flink">

```shell
cd "apache-seatunnel-incubating-${version}"
./bin/start-seatunnel-flink-connector-v2.sh \
--config ./config/seatunnel.streaming.conf.template
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="SeaTunnel Engine">

```shell
cd "apache-seatunnel-incubating-${version}"
./bin/seatunnel.sh \
--config ./config/seatunnel.streaming.conf.template -e local
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**See The Output**: When you run the command, you could see its output in your console or in Flink/Spark UI, You can think this
is a sign that the command ran successfully or not.

The SeaTunnel console will prints some logs as below:

```shell
fields : name, age
types : STRING, INT
row=1 : elWaB, 1984352560
row=2 : uAtnp, 762961563
row=3 : TQEIB, 2042675010
row=4 : DcFjo, 593971283
row=5 : SenEb, 2099913608
row=6 : DHjkg, 1928005856
row=7 : eScCM, 526029657
row=8 : sgOeE, 600878991
row=9 : gwdvw, 1951126920
row=10 : nSiKE, 488708928
row=11 : xubpl, 1420202810
row=12 : rHZqb, 331185742
row=13 : rciGD, 1112878259
row=14 : qLhdI, 1457046294
row=15 : ZTkRx, 1240668386
row=16 : SGZCr, 94186144
```

If use Flink, The content printed in the TaskManager Stdout log of `flink WebUI`.

## What's More

For now, you are already take a quick look about SeaTunnel, you could see [connector](/category/connector) to find all
source and sink SeaTunnel supported. Or see [deployment](../deployment.mdx) if you want to submit your application in other
kind of your engine cluster.
