# Talk With Overseas contributors | Why do I contribute to SeaTunnel?

As SeaTunnel gets popular around the world, it is attracting more and more contributors from overseas to join the open-source career. Among them, a big data platform engineer at Kakao enterprise corp., Namgung Chan has recently contributed the Neo4j Sink Connector for the SeaTunnel. We have a talk with him to know why SeaTunnel is attractive to him, and how he thinks SeaTunnel should gain popularity in the South Korean market.

### Contributions to the community
He writes the Neo4j Sink Connector code for the new SeaTunnel Connector API.

### How to know SeaTunnel for the first time?
It’s the first time Namgung Chan to engage in open source. He wants to learn technical skills by contributing, at the same time experience the open-source culture.

For him, an open source project which is written by java lang, and made for data engineering, has many issues of ‘help wanted’ or ‘good first issue’ is quite suitable. Then he found SeaTunnel on the Apache Software Foundation project webpage.

### The first impression of SeaTunnel Community
Though it was his first open source experience, he felt it was comfortable and interesting to go to the community. He also felt very welcome, because there are many ‘good first issue, and ‘volunteer wanted’ tagged issues and will get a quick response of code review.

With gaining knowledge of Neo4j, he grows much more confident in open source contribution.

### Research and comparison
Before knowing about SeaTunnel, Namgung Chan used Spring Cloud Data Flow for data integration. While after experiencing SeaTunnel, he thinks the latter is more lightweight than SCDF, because in SCDF, every source, processor, and sink component are individual applications, but SeaTunnel is not.

Though hasn’t used SeaTunnel in his working environment yet, Namgung Chan said he would like to use it positively when he is in need, especially for data integration for various data storage.


### Expectations for SeaTunnel
The most exciting new features or optimizations for Namgung Chan are:

Data Integration for various data storage.
Strict data validation. monitoring extension
Low computing resource
exactly-once data processing
In the future, Namgung Chan plans to keep contributing from light issues to heavy ones, and we hope he will have a good time here!
