# Innovation of Data Integration Technology in the Intelligent Era



![1](/image/20220416/EN/1.png)


As we know, only manageable, callable, computable, and magnetizable data resources can be deposited as assets. The interconnection of information systems has created a huge demand for multi-source and multidimensional data integration, which imposes strict requirements on data processing and integration tools.

In the era of intelligence, under the trends of “smart city”, “smart governance”, and “intelligent products”, enterprises are mostly faced with the challenge of how to achieve efficient data push, improve platform quality, and ensure data security. Only by choosing the right data integration tools and platforms can data play a key role.

As a next-generation high-performance, distributed, and massive data integration framework, Apache SeaTunnel is committed to making data synchronization simpler and more efficient and accelerating the implementation of distributed data processing capabilities in the production environment.

At the Apache SeaTunnel Meetup (April 16, 2022), the community will invite experienced Apache SeaTunnel users to share the best practices of the project in intelligent production environments. In addition, there will be contributors to analyze the source code of Apache SeaTunnel, guiding you to have a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of this powerful data integration tool.

Whether you are a beginner who is interested in Apache SeaTunnel or users who encounter complex and difficult deployment problems in daily practice, you can come here to communicate with our instructors and get the answers you want.
