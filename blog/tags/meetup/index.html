The reason why the team decided to develop a self-developed engine was that SeaTunnel&#x27;s connector can run only on Flink or Spark, and Flink and Spark, as computing engines, have many unsolvable problems when integrating and synchronizing data.</p><p>Refer to:
Why do we self-develop the big data synchronization engine SeaTunnel Zeta?
<a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-seatunnel/issues/1954" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/apache/incubator-seatunnel/issues/1954</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="02-design-ideas">02 Design ideas<a href="#02-design-ideas" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 02 Design ideas" title="Direct link to 02 Design ideas">​</a></h2><p>The general idea of engine design is as follows:</p><ol><li>Simple and easy to use, the new engine minimizes the dependence on third-party services, and can realize cluster management, snapshot storage, and cluster HA functions without relying on big data components such as Zookeeper and HDFS. This is very useful for users who do not have a big data platform or are unwilling to rely on a big data platform for data synchronization.</li><li>More resource-saving, at the CPU level, Zeta Engine internally uses Dynamic Thread Sharing (dynamic thread sharing) technology. In the real-time synchronization scenario, if the number of tables is large but the amount of data in each table is small, Zeta Engine will Synchronous tasks run in shared threads, which can reduce unnecessary thread creation and save system resources. On the read and data write side, the Zeta Engine is designed to minimize the number of JDBC connections. In the CDC scenario, Zeta Engine will try to reuse log reading and parsing resources as much as possible.</li><li>More stable. In this version, Zeta Engine uses Pipeline as the minimum granularity of Checkpoint and fault tolerance for data synchronization tasks. The failure of a task will only affect the tasks that have upstream and downstream relationships with it. Try to avoid task failures that cause the entire Job to fail. or rollback. At the same time, for scenarios where the source data has a storage time limit, Zeta Engine supports enabling data cache to automatically cache the data read from the source, and then the downstream tasks read the cached data and write it to the target. In this scenario, even if the target end fails and data cannot be written, it will not affect the normal reading of the source end, preventing the source end data from being deleted due to expiration.</li><li>Faster, Zeta Engine’s execution plan optimizer will optimize the execution plan to reduce the possible network transmission of data, thereby reducing the loss of overall synchronization performance caused by data serialization and deserialization, and completing faster Data synchronization operations. Of course, it also supports speed limiting, so that sync jobs can be performed at a reasonable speed.</li><li>Data synchronization support for all scenarios. SeaTunnel aims to support full synchronization and incremental synchronization under offline batch synchronization, and support real-time synchronization and CDC.</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="03-architecture-design">03 Architecture design<a href="#03-architecture-design" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 03 Architecture design" title="Direct link to 03 Architecture design">​</a></h2><p>SeaTunnel Engine is mainly composed of a set of APIs for data synchronization processing and a core computing engine. Here we mainly introduce the architecture design of the SeaTunnel Engine core engine.

picture</p><p>SeaTunnel Engine consists of three main services: <strong>CoordinatorService, TaskExecutionService, and SlotService.</strong></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="coordinator-service">Coordinator Service<a href="#coordinator-service" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Coordinator Service" title="Direct link to Coordinator Service">​</a></h3><p>CoordinatorService is the Master service of the cluster, which provides the generation process of each job from LogicalDag to ExecutionDag, and then to PhysicalDag, and finally creates the JobMaster of the job for scheduling execution and status monitoring of the job. CoordinatorService is mainly composed of 4 large functional modules:</p><ol><li>JobMaster is responsible for the generation process from LogicalDag to ExecutionDag to PhysicalDag of a single job, and is scheduled to run by PipelineBaseScheduler.</li><li>CheckpointCoordinator, responsible for the Checkpoint process control of the job.</li><li>ResourceManager is responsible for the application and management of job resources. It currently supports Standalone mode and will support On Yarn and On K8s in the future.</li><li>Metrics Service, responsible for the statistics and summary of job monitoring information.</li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="taskexecutionservice">TaskExecutionService<a href="#taskexecutionservice" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to TaskExecutionService" title="Direct link to TaskExecutionService">​</a></h3><p>TaskExecutionService is the Worker service of the cluster, which provides the real runtime environment of each Task in the job.

To achieve cluster autonomy and job fault tolerance without relying on third-party service components (such as Zookeeper), SeaTunnel Engine uses Hazelcast as the underlying dependency. Hazelcast provides a distributed memory network, allowing users to operate a distributed collection like a normal Java collection locally. SeaTunnel saves the status information of the job in the memory grid of Hazelcast. When the Master node switches, it can Job state recovery based on data in the Hazelcast in-memory grid. At the same time, we have also implemented the persistence of Hazelcast memory grid data, and persisted the job status information to the storage (database of JDBC protocol, HDFS, cloud storage) in the form of WAL. In this way, even if the entire cluster hangs and restarts, the runtime information of the job can be repaired.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="data-cache">Data cache<a href="#data-cache" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Data cache" title="Direct link to Data cache">​</a></h3><p>SeaTunnel Engine is different from the traditional Spark/Flink computing engine, it is an engine specially used for data synchronization. The SeaTunnel engine naturally supports data cache. When multiple synchronous jobs in the cluster share a data source, the SeaTunnel engine will automatically enable the data cache. The source of a job will read the data and write it into the cache, and all other jobs will no longer read data from the data source but are automatically optimized to read data from the Cache. The advantage of this is that it can reduce the reading pressure of the data source and reduce the impact of data synchronization on the data source.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="speed-control">Speed control<a href="#speed-control" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Speed control" title="Direct link to Speed control">​</a></h3><p>SeaTunnel Engine supports the speed limit during data synchronization, which is very useful when reading data sources with high concurrency. A reasonable speed limit can not only ensure that the data is synchronized on time, but also minimize the pressure on the data source.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="shared-connection-pool-to-reduce-database-pressure">Shared connection pool to reduce database pressure<a href="#shared-connection-pool-to-reduce-database-pressure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Shared connection pool to reduce database pressure" title="Direct link to Shared connection pool to reduce database pressure">​</a></h3><p>At present, the underlying operating tools and data synchronization tools provided by computing engines such as Spark/Flink cannot solve the problem that each table needs a JDBC connection when the entire database is synchronized. Database connections are resources for the database. Too many database connections will put great pressure on the database, resulting in a decrease in the stability of database read and write delays. This is a very serious accident for business databases. To solve this problem, SeaTunnel Engine uses a shared connection pool to ensure that multiple tables can share JDBC connections, thereby reducing the use of database connections.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="breakpoint-resume-incrementalfull-volume">Breakpoint resume (incremental/full volume)<a href="#breakpoint-resume-incrementalfull-volume" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Breakpoint resume (incremental/full volume)" title="Direct link to Breakpoint resume (incremental/full volume)">​</a></h3><p>SeaTunnel Engine supports resumed uploads under offline synchronization. When the amount of data is large, a data synchronization job often needs to run for tens of minutes or several hours. If the middle job hangs up and reruns, it means wasting time. SeaTunnel Engine will continue to save the state (checkpoint) during the offline synchronization process. When the job hangs up and reruns, it will continue to run from the last checkpoint, which effectively solves the data that may be caused by hardware problems such as node downtime.

Most commonly, it is used when performing an append or overwrite operation, to automatically adjust the schema to include one or more new columns.</p><p>This capability is required in real-time data warehouse scenarios. Currently, the Flink and Spark engines do not support this feature.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fine-grained-fault-tolerant-design">Fine-grained fault-tolerant design<a href="#fine-grained-fault-tolerant-design" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Fine-grained fault-tolerant design" title="Direct link to Fine-grained fault-tolerant design">​</a></h3><p>Flink&#x27;s design is fault tolerance and rollback at the entire job level. If a task fails, the entire job will be rolled back and restarted. The design of SeaTunnel Engine takes into account that in the data synchronization scenario, in many q cases, the failure of a task should only need to focus on fault tolerance for tasks that have upstream and downstream relationships with it. Based on this design principle, SeaTunnel Engine will first generate a logical DAG according to the user-configured job configuration file, then optimize the logical DAG, and finally generate a pipeline (a connected subgraph in a job DAG) to call and execute jobs at the granularity. fault tolerance.</p><p>A typical usage scenario is:</p><p>Use the CDC connector to read data from MySQL&#x27;s binlog and write it to another MySQL. If you use Flink or Spark engine, once the target MySQL cannot write, it will cause the task of CDC to read the binlog to be terminated. If MySQL is set If the expiration time of the log is set, the problem of the target MySQL is solved, but the log of the source MySQL is cleared, which leads to data loss and other problems.</p><p>SeaTunnel Engine will automatically optimize this synchronization task, automatically add the source to the target Cache, and then further optimize this job into two Pipelines, pipeline#1 is responsible for reading data from the CDC and writing it to the SeaTunnel Cache, and pipeline#2 is responsible for reading data from the SeaTunnel Cache Cache reads data and writes to target MySQL. If there is a problem with the target MySQL and cannot be written, the pipeline#2 of this synchronization job will be terminated, and the pipeline#1 will still run normally. This design fundamentally solves the above problems and is more in line with the processing logic of the data synchronization engine.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dynamically-share-threads-to-reduce-resource-usage">Dynamically share threads to reduce resource usage<a href="#dynamically-share-threads-to-reduce-resource-usage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Dynamically share threads to reduce resource usage" title="Direct link to Dynamically share threads to reduce resource usage">​</a></h3><p>SeaTunnel Engine&#x27;s Task design uses shared thread technology. Different from Flink/Spark, SeaTunnel Engine does not simply allow a Task to occupy a thread, but through a dynamic perception method - Dynamic Thread Sharing (Dynamic Thread Sharing) To judge whether a Task should share a thread with other Tasks or should monopolize a thread.</p><p>Compared with single-threaded serial computing, multi-threaded parallel computing has better performance advantages, but if each Task uses an independent thread to run, when there are many tables for data synchronization and the number of Tasks is large, it will be in the Worker node Start very many threads on it. When the number of CPU cores is fixed, the more threads, the better. When the number of threads is too large, the CPU needs to spend a lot of time on thread context switching, which will affect computing performance.</p><p>Flink/Spark usually limits the maximum number of tasks running on each node. In this way, it can avoid starting too many threads. To run more tasks on one node, SeaTunnel Engine can share thread technology. Let those tasks with a small amount of data share threads, and tasks with a large amount of data exclusively use threads. This method makes it possible for SeaTunnel Engine to run hundreds or thousands of table synchronization tasks on one node, with less resource occupation. Complete the synchronization of more tables.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="05-basic-functions-and-features">05 Basic functions and features<a href="#05-basic-functions-and-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 05 Basic functions and features" title="Direct link to 05 Basic functions and features">​</a></h2><p>2.3.0 is the first official version of SeaTunnel Engine, which implements some basic functions.

The left-hand side briefly lists the Source scenarios, for example, we abstract the Source’s API, Type, and State, to read the data source, unifying the data types of the various data sources to the abstract type defined in it, and some state recovery and retention of the read location during the reading process.</p><p>This is an abstraction for Source, and we have done a similar abstraction for Sink, i.e. how data is written, and how the data type matches the real data source type, and how the state is restored and retained.</p><p>Based on these APIs, we will have a translation layer to translate these APIs to the corresponding execution engine. SeaTunnel currently supports three execution engines, Spark, Flink, and our own execution engine, SeaTunnel Engine, which will be released soon.</p><p>This is roughly what SeaTunnel does, SeaTunnel relies on Source and Sink to read and write data for data synchronization, we call them Connectors. The Connector consists of a Source and a Sink.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/16714316928812-337c3d4770094c09ae55a5312670d87f.jpg" width="720" height="758" class="img_ev3q">
From the diagram above we see the different data sources, Source is responsible for reading data from the various data sources and transforming it into SeaTunnelRow abstraction layer and Type to form the abstraction layer, Sink is responsible for pulling data from the abstraction layer and writing it to the concrete data store to transform it into the store concrete format.</p><p>The combination of Source + Abstraction Layer + Sink enables the synchronization of data between multiple heterogeneous data sources.</p><p>I’ll use a simple example below to illustrate how SeaTunnel’s Source and Sink work.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/16714317022389-f17930bc8877d173d40eab8fdfe47631.jpg" width="720" height="822" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/16714317067444-f828b5a72003d3caec8958edccdc8dca.jpg" width="720" height="340" class="img_ev3q">

Firstly, there are the typical usage scenarios supported by Source, such as bulk reading of devices, field projection, data type mapping, parallel reading, etc.</p><p>As you can see above, IoTDB supports all features except once, exactly once and stream mode, such as batch reads, IoTDB has a SQL syntax similar to group by device, which allows you to read data from multiple devices in a single batch. For basic data type projection, the SQL in IoTDB will take time by default when looking up any metric, or group by the device will take the device column, and we also support projection onto SeaTunnel columns by default.</p><p>The only data type not supported is Victor, all others are supported.</p><p>For the parallel read piece, the IoTDB data is actually timestamped and we use timestamped ranges to achieve parallel reads.</p><p>The recovery of the state, since we have divided the time range read into different splits, can be done based on the Split location information.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sink-functional-features">Sink functional features<a href="#sink-functional-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Sink functional features" title="Direct link to Sink functional features">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/16714317679569-a1923e70d93e6204c42aa7531a96a024.jpg" width="720" height="372" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The diagram above shows the features already supported by SeaTunnel.

Assuming there is a table in IoTDB, we project the device column onto SeaTunnel by making it data as well through syntax.

For distributed streaming processing systems, high throughput and low latency are often the most important requirements. At the same time, fault tolerance is also very important in distributed systems. For scenarios that require high correctness, the implementation of exactly once is often very important.</p><p>In a distributed streaming processing system, since the computing power, network, load, etc. of each node are different, the state of each node cannot be directly merged to obtain a true global state. To obtain consistent results, the distributed processing system needs to be resilient to node failure, that is, it can recover to consistent results when it fails.</p><p>Although it is claimed in their official blog that Spark’s Structured Streaming uses the Chandy-Lamport algorithm for Failover processing, it does not disclose more details.</p><p>Flink implemented Checkpoint as a fault-tolerant mechanism based on the above algorithm and published related papers: Lightweight Asynchronous Snapshots for Distributed Dataflows</p><p>In the current industrial implementation, when a job fails, all nodes of the job DAG need to failover, and the whole process will last for a long time, which will cause a lot of upstream data to accumulate.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="loss-of-data">Loss of Data<a href="#loss-of-data" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Loss of Data" title="Direct link to Loss of Data">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/16714312426416-f778eaa67ecf527449353404cf0bf421.jpg" width="720" height="175" class="img_ev3q">
The previous problem will cause a long-time recovery, and the business service may accept a certain degree of data delay.</p><p>In a worse case, a single sink node cannot be recovered for a long time, and the source data has a limited storage time, such as MySQL and Oracle log data, which will lead to data loss.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="configuration-is-cumbersome">Configuration is cumbersome<a href="#configuration-is-cumbersome" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Configuration is cumbersome" title="Direct link to Configuration is cumbersome">​</a></h2><p>Single table Configuration</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/16714312637015-abff06af8bf814cbb39e2fddfd5b0271.jpg" width="720" height="360" class="img_ev3q">

Besides, according to the research report of Fivetran, 60% of the company’s schema will change every month, and 30% will change every week.</p><p>However, none of the existing engines supports Schema Evolution.

If our Source or Sink is of JDBC type, since the existing engine only supports one or more links per table, when there are many tables to be synchronized, more link resources will be occupied, which will bring a great burden to the database server.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="operator-pressure-is-uncontrollable">Operator pressure is uncontrollable<a href="#operator-pressure-is-uncontrollable" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Operator pressure is uncontrollable" title="Direct link to Operator pressure is uncontrollable">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/16714313301435-5d797838b956772428477a7a26a2591c.jpg" width="720" height="333" class="img_ev3q">
In the existing engine, a buffer and other control operators are used to control the pressure, that is, the back pressure mechanism; since the back pressure is transmitted level by level, there will be pressure delay, and at the same time, the processing of data will not be smooth enough, increasing the GC time, fault-tolerant completion time, etc.</p><p>Another case is that neither the source nor the sink has reached the maximum pressure, but the user still needs to control the synchronization rate to prevent too much impact on the source database or the target database, which cannot be controlled through the back pressure mechanism.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="architecture-goals-of-apache-seatunnel-engine">Architecture goals of Apache SeaTunnel Engine<a href="#architecture-goals-of-apache-seatunnel-engine" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Architecture goals of Apache SeaTunnel Engine" title="Direct link to Architecture goals of Apache SeaTunnel Engine">​</a></h2><p>To solve these severe issues faced by computing engines, we self-developed our engine expertise in big data integration.</p><p>Firstly, let’s get through what goals this engine wants to achieve.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pipeline-failover">Pipeline Failover<a href="#pipeline-failover" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Pipeline Failover" title="Direct link to Pipeline Failover">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/16714313559400-d6029daeb8672d49a5bfb8718c518e3f.jpg" width="720" height="176" class="img_ev3q">
In the data integration case, there is a possibility that a job can synchronize hundreds of sheets, and the failure of one node or one table will lead to the failure of all tables, which is too costly.</p><p>We expect that unrelated Job Tasks will not affect each other during fault tolerance, so we call a vertex collection with upstream and downstream relationships a Pipeline, and a Job can consist of one or more pipelines.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="regional-failover">Regional Failover<a href="#regional-failover" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Regional Failover" title="Direct link to Regional Failover">​</a></h2><p>Now if there is an exception in the pipeline, we still need to failover all the vertex in the pipeline; but can we restore only part of the vertex?

For example, if the Source fails, the Sink does not need to restart. In the case of a single Source and multiple Sinks, if a single Sink fails, only the Sink and Source that failed will be restored; that is, only the node that failed and its upstream nodes will be restored.</p><p>Obviously, the stateless vertex does not need to be restarted, and since SeaTunnel is a data integration framework, we do not have aggregation state vertexes such as Agg and Count, so we only need to consider Sink;</p><ul><li>Sink does not support idempotence &amp; 2PC; no restart and restart will result in the same data duplication, which can only be solved by Sink without restarting;</li><li>Sink supports idempotence, but does not support 2PC: because it is idempotent writing, it does not matter whether the source reads data inconsistently every time, and it does not need to be restarted;</li><li>Sink supports 2PC:</li><li>If the Source supports data consistency, if an abort is not executed, the processed old data will be automatically ignored through the channel data ID, and at the same time, it will face the problem that the transaction session time may time out;</li><li>If the Source does not support data consistency, perform abort on the Sink to discard the last data, which has the same effect as restarting but does not require initialization operations such as re-establishing links;</li><li>That is, the simplest implementation is to execute abort.

For sink failure, when data cannot be written, a possible solution is to work two jobs at the same time.</p><p>One job reads the database logs using the CDC source connector and then writes the data to Kafka using the Kafka Sink connector. Another job reads data from Kafka using the Kafka source connector and writes data to the destination using the destination sink connector.</p><p>This solution requires users to have a deep understanding of the underlying technology, and both tasks will increase the difficulty of operation and maintenance. Because every job needs JobMaster, it requires more resources.</p><p>Ideally, the user only knows that they will be reading data from the source and writing data to the sink, and at the same time, during this process, the data can be cached in case the sink fails. The sync engine needs to automatically add caching operations to the execution plan and ensure that the source still works in the event of a sink failure. In this process, the engine needs to ensure that the data written to the cache and read from the cache are transactional, to ensure data consistency.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sharding--multi-table-sync">Sharding &amp; Multi-table Sync<a href="#sharding--multi-table-sync" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Sharding &amp; Multi-table Sync" title="Direct link to Sharding &amp; Multi-table Sync">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/16714314489916-cd0b185b6626a8c1598aa3ac569ecdbd.jpg" width="720" height="448" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>For a large number of table synchronization, we expect that a single Source can support reading multiple structural tables, and then use the side stream output to keep consistent with a single table stream.</p><p>The advantage of this is that it can reduce the link occupation of the data source and improve the utilization rate of thread resources.</p><p>At the same time, in SeaTunnel Engine, these multiple tables will be regarded as a pipeline, which will increase the granularity of fault tolerance; there are trade-offs, and the user can choose how many tables a pipeline can pass through.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="schema-evolution">Schema Evolution<a href="#schema-evolution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Schema Evolution" title="Direct link to Schema Evolution">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/16714314658701-b97c66b4a4eacfe54acf2e5ea6cc001b.jpg" width="720" height="199" class="img_ev3q">

As for the problems that cannot be solved by the back pressure mechanism, we will optimize the Buffer and Checkpoint mechanism:</p><ul><li>Firstly, We try to allow Buffer to control the amount of data in a period;</li><li>Secondly, by the Checkpoint mechanism, the engine can lock the buffer after the Checkpoint reaches the maximum number of parallelism and executes an interval time, prohibiting the writing of Source data, achieving the result of taking the pressure proactively, avoiding issues like back pressure delay or failure to be delivered to Source.

SeaTunnel’s API consists of three main parts.</p><p>The first part is the SeaTunnel base API, which provides the basic abstract interfaces such as Source, Sink, Transform, and Plugin.</p><p>The second part is based on a set of interfaces Transform, Sink, Source, Runtime, and Execution provided by the SeaTunnel base API, which is wrapped and implemented on the Flink and Spark engines respectively, i.e. Spark engine API layer abstraction and Flink engine API layer abstraction.</p><p>Both Flink and Spark engines support stream and batch processing, so there are different ways to use streams/batches under the Flink API abstraction and Spark abstraction APIs, such as Flinkstream and Flinkbatch under the Flink abstraction API, and Sparkbatch and Sparkstreaming under the Spark abstraction API.</p><p>The third part is the plug-in system, based on Spark abstraction and Flink API abstraction, SeaTunnel engine implements rich connectors and processing plug-ins, while developers can also be based on different engine API abstractions, and extensions to achieve their own Plugin.</p><p>SeaTunnel Implementation Principle
Currently, SeaTunnel offers a variety of ways to use Flink, Spark, and FlinkSQL. Due to space limitations, we will introduce the execution principles of the Spark method.</p><p>First, the entry starts the command Start-seatunnel-spark.sh via the shell, which internally calls Sparkstarter’s Class, which parses the parameters passed by the shell script, and also parses the Config file to determine which Connectors are defined in the Config file, such as Fake, Console, etc.

The core Source API interaction flow is shown above.

The overall Sink API interaction flow is shown in the diagram below.

The main git commands used in development are git clone, git pull, git rebase and git merge. git rebase is recommended in the community development specification and does not generate additional commits compared to git merge.</li><li>Familiarity with GitHub project collaboration process
Open source projects are developed collaboratively by multiple people, and the collaboration method on GitHub is at its core outlined in fork For example, the apache st project, which is under the apache space, is first forked to our own space on GitHub</li></ul><p>Then modify the implementation, mention a pull request, and submit the pull request to be associated with the issue, in the commit, if we change a long time, in the upward commit, then the target branch has a lot of new commits exhausted this time we need to do a pull&amp; merge or rebase.</p><ul><li>Source code compilation project
It is important to be familiar with source compilation, as local source compilation can prove that the code added to a project can be compiled, and can be used as a preliminary check before committing to pr.

At the same time, switch the branch to api-draft, and currently use this branch to develop the new version of the API and the corresponding Connector. The project structure is as follows:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Project Structure" src="/assets/images/0-82b23e9c80c8b70ce10feaccfc96a2a6.png" width="583" height="1014" class="img_ev3q"></p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prerequisites">Prerequisites<a href="#prerequisites" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Prerequisites" title="Direct link to Prerequisites">​</a></h2><ul><li><p>At present, in order to distinguish different Connectors, we put the connectors that support</p><ul><li>Flink/Spark under the <code>seatunnel-connectors/seatunnel-connectors-flink(spark)</code> module.</li><li>New version of the Connector is placed under the <code>seatunnel-connectors/seatunnel-connectors-seatunnel</code> module.</li></ul><p>As we can see from the above figure, we have implemented Fake, Console, Kafka Connector, and Clickhouse Connector is also being implemented.</p></li><li><p>At present, the data type we support is SeaTunnelRow, so no matter the type of data generated by the Source or the type of data consumed by the Sink, it should be SeaTunnelRow.</p></li></ul><h1>Development of Connector</h1><p>Taking Fake Connector as an example, let&#x27;s introduce how to implement a new Connector:</p><ul><li><p>Create a corresponding module with a path under <code>seatunnel-connectors-seatunnel</code>, which is at the same level as other new connectors.</p></li><li><p>Modify the <code>seatunnel-connectors-seatunnel/pom.xml</code> file, add a new module to modules, modify <code>seatunnel-connectors-seatunnel/seatunnel-connector-seatunnel-fake/pom.xml</code>, add seatunnel-api dependencies, and correct parent Quote.

In order to solve these problems, Li Zongwen aimed to decouple Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) from thw computing engines, and re-factor the Source and Sink apis to improve the development experience.</p><p>This speech mainly consists of five parts.The first part is about Apache SeaTunnel (Incubator) refactoring background and motivation. The second part introduces Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) Target for refactoring.The third part discusses Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) overall design for refactoring. The last two parts is about Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) Source API design and Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) Sink API design.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="01-background-and-motivation-for-refactoring">01 Background and motivation for refactoring<a href="#01-background-and-motivation-for-refactoring" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 01 Background and motivation for refactoring" title="Direct link to 01 Background and motivation for refactoring">​</a></h2><p>Those of you who have used Apache SeaTunnel (Incubator) or developers should know that Apache SeaTunnel (Incubator) is now fully coupled with the engine, which is entirely based on Spark or Flink, and so are the configuration file parameters. From the perspective of contributors and users, we can find they face some problems.</p><p>In the view of the contributors, repeated implementing connector is meaningless and it is unable for potential contributors to contribute to the community due to inconsistent engine versions.</p><p>At present, many companies use Lambda architecture, Spark is used for offline operations and Flink is used for real-time operations. In the view of the users, it can be found that Spark may have the Connector of SeaTunnel, but Flink does not, and the parameters of the two engines for the Connector of the same storage engine are not unified, thus resulting a high cost of and deviating from its original intention of being easy to use. And some users question that Flink version 1.14 is not supported nowadays. While with the current SeaTunnel architecture, we must discard the previous version in order to support Flink version 1.14, which will bring great trouble for early version users.</p><p>As a result, it was difficult for us to either upgrade engine or support more versions.</p><p>In addition, Spark and Flink both adopt the Checkpoint fault-tolerant mechanism implemented by Chandy-Lamport algorithm and internally unify DataSet and DataStream. On this premise, we believe decoupling is feasible.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="02-apache-seatunnel-incubating-decouples-with-computing-engine">02 Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) decouples with computing engine<a href="#02-apache-seatunnel-incubating-decouples-with-computing-engine" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 02 Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) decouples with computing engine" title="Direct link to 02 Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) decouples with computing engine">​</a></h2><p>Therefore, in order to solve the problems raised above, we set the following goals.</p><ol><li><p>Connector is only implemented once. To solve the problems that parameters are not unified and Connector is implemented for too many times, we hope to achieve a unified Source and Sink API;</p></li><li><p>Multiple versions of Spark and Flink engines are supported. A translation layer above the Source and Sink API is added to support multiple versions of Spark and Flink engines.</p></li><li><p>The logic for parallel shard of Source and the Sink submission should be clarified. We must provide a good API to support Connector development.</p></li><li><p>The full database synchronization in real-time scenarios should be supported. This is a derivative requirement that many users have mentioned for CDC support. I once participated the Flink CDC community before and many users pointed out that in the CDC scenario, if you wanted to use the Flink CDC directly, each table would have a link and there would be thousands of links for thousands of tables when you need to synchronize the whole library, which was unacceptable for both the database and the DBA. To solve this problem, the simplest way was to introduce Canal、Debezium or other components, which were used to pull incremental data to Kafka or other MQ for intermediate storage, and then we could use Flink SQL for synchronization. This actually contradicted the original idea of the Flink CDC to reduce links. However, the Flink CDC aimed only a Connector and was unable to deal with the whole link, so the proposal was not seen in the SeaTunnel community. By the chance of the reconstruction, we submitted the proposal to the SeaTunnel community.</p></li><li><p>Automatic discovery and storage of meta information are realized. The users should have awful experience due to the storage engines such as Kafka lacking of record of the data structure, when we need to read structured data, the user must define the topic of structured data types before read one topic at a time . We hope once the configuration is completed, there is no need to do any redundant work again.</p></li></ol><p>Some people may wonder why we don’t use Apache Beam directly. That is because Beam sources are divided into BOUNDED and UNBOUNDED sources, which means it needs to be implemented twice. Moreover, some features of Source and Sink are not supported, which will be mentioned later.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="03-apache-seatunnelincubating-overall-design-for-refactoring">03 Apache SeaTunnel(Incubating) overall design for refactoring<a href="#03-apache-seatunnelincubating-overall-design-for-refactoring" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 03 Apache SeaTunnel(Incubating) overall design for refactoring" title="Direct link to 03 Apache SeaTunnel(Incubating) overall design for refactoring">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/1-cbc169e3bc121f1008b807103abe9fd8.jpg" width="1440" height="810" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The Apache SeaTunnel(Incubating) API architecture is described in the picture above.</p><p>The Source &amp; Sink API is one of the core APIS of data integration, which defines the logic for parallel shard of Source and the commitment of Sink to realize the Connector.</p><p>The Engine API includes the translation and the execution layers. The translation is used to translate Souce and Sink API of SeaTunnel into connectors that can be run inside the engine.</p><p>The execution defines the execution logic of Source, Transform, Sink and other operations in the engine.</p><p>The Table SPI is mainly used to expose the interface of Source and Sink in SPI mode, and to specify mandatory and optional parameters of Connector etc.</p><p>The DataType includes SeaTunnel data structure used to isolate engines and declare Table schema.</p><p>The Catalog is Used to obtain Table schemes and Options, etc. The Catalog Storage is used to store Table Schemes defined by unstructured engines such as Kafka.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2-507471aef3b2e7dc6ee4bc03188bc784.jpg" width="1440" height="810" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The execution flow we assumed nowadays can be see in the above picture.</p><ol><li><p>Obtain task parameters from configuration files or UI.</p></li><li><p>Obtain the Table Schema, Option and other information by analyzing the parameters from Catalog.</p></li><li><p>Pull up the Connector of SeaTunnel in SPI mode and inject Table information.</p></li><li><p>Translate the Connector from SeaTunnel into the Connector within the engine.</p></li><li><p>Execute the operation logic of the engine.

We want to preserve that SQL capability for users to upgrade seamlessly.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/3-68113e215aa8e91a5d2469ccb37a3c22.jpg" width="1440" height="810" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>According to our research, the feature above shows the ideal execution logic of Source and Sink. Since SeaTunnel is incubated as WaterDrop, the terms in the figure are tended towards Spark.</p><p>Ideally, the Source and Sink coordinators can be run on the Driver, and the Source Reader and Sink Writer will run on the Worker. In terms of the Source Coordinator, we expect it to support several features.</p><p>The first capability is that the slicing logic of data can be dynamically added to the Reader.</p><p>The second is that the coordination of Reader can be supported. Source Reader is used to read data, and then send the data to the engine, and finally to the Source Writer for data writing. Meanwhile, Writer can support the two-phase transaction submission, and the coordinator of Sink supports the aggregation submission requirements of Connector such as Iceberg.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="04-source-api">04 Source API<a href="#04-source-api" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 04 Source API" title="Direct link to 04 Source API">​</a></h2><p>After research, we found the following features that are required by Source.</p><ol><li><p>Unified offline and real-time API , which supports that source is implemented only once and supports both offline and real-time API;</p></li><li><p>Supportive of parallel reading. For example that Kafka generates a reader for each partition and execute in parallel.</p></li><li><p>Supporting dynamic slice-adding. For example, Kafka defines a regular topic, when a new topic needs to be added due to the volume of business, the Source API allows to dynamically add the slice to the job.</p></li><li><p>Supporting the work of coordinating reader, which is currently only needed in the CDC Connector. CDC is currently supported by NetFilx’s DBlog parallel algorithms, which requires reader coordination between full synchronization and incremental synchronization.</p></li><li><p>Supporting a single reader to process multiple tables, i.e. to allows the whole database synchronization in the real-time scenario as mentioned above.</p></li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/4-ac907e3f8e305b9f6585d2171013a973.jpg" width="1440" height="810" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Based on the above requirements, we have created the basic API as shown in the figure above.

For those connectors that do not need coordinators, we have a Source that supports parallel execution and engine translation.</p><p>As shown in the figure above, there is a slice enumerator on the left, which can list which slices the source needs and show what there are. After enumerating slices in real time, each slice would be distributed to SourceReader, the real data reading module. Boundedness marker is used to differentiate offline and real-time operations. Connector can mark whether there is a stop Offset in a slice. For example, Kafka can support real-time and offline operations. The degree of parallelism can be set for the ParallelSource in the engine to support parallel reading.</p><p>As shown in the figure above, in a scenario where a coordinator is required, Event transmission is done between the Reader and Enumerator. Enumerator coordinates events by the Event sent by the Reader. The Coordinated Source needs to ensure single parallelism at the engine level to ensure data consistency. Of course, this does not make good use of the engine’s memory management mechanism, but trade-offs are necessary.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/6-ef5d53449db28f4466c14827335d07a6.jpg" width="1440" height="810" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>For the last question, how can we support a single reader to process multiple tables? This involves the Table API layer. Once all the required tables have been read from the Catalog, some of the tables may belong to a single job and can be read by a link, and some may need to be separated, depending on how Source is implemented. Since this is a special requirement, we want to make it easier for the developers. In the Table API layer, we will provide a SupportMultipleTable interface to declare that Source supports multiple Table reads. The Source is implemented based on the corresponding deserializer of multiple tables. As for how to separate derived multi-table data, Flink will adopt Side Output mechanism, while Spark is going to use Filter or Partition mechanism.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5-sink-api">5 Sink API<a href="#5-sink-api" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 5 Sink API" title="Direct link to 5 Sink API">​</a></h2><p>At present, there are not many features required by Sink, but three mojor requirements are considerable according to our research.</p><p>The first is about idempotent writing, which requires no code and depends on whether the storage engine can support it.</p><p>The second is about distributed transactions. The mainstream method is two-phase commitments, such as Kafka etc.</p><p>The third is about the submission of aggregation. For Storage engines like Iceberg and Hoodie, we hope there is no issues triggered by small files, so we expect to aggregate these files into a single file and commit it as a whole.</p><p>Based on these three requirements, we built three APIS: SinkWriter, SinkCommitter, and SinkAggregated Committer. SinkWriter plays a role of writing, which may or may not be idempotent. SinkCommitter supports for two-phase commitments. SinkAggregatedCommitter supports for aggregated commitments.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/7-e9830d63f81f7139a7cd1d4d9b9f5e43.jpg" width="1440" height="810" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Ideally, AggregatedCommitter runs in Driver in single or parallel, and Writer and Committer run in Worker with multiple parallels, with each parallel carrying its own pre-commit work and then send Aggregated messages to Aggregated committers.</p><p>Current advanced versions of Spark and Flink all support AggregatedCommitter running on the Driver(Job Manager) and Writer and Committer running on the worker(Task Manager).</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/8-aa0537c76d15543b46623445ff00e490.jpg" width="1440" height="810" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>However, for the lower versions of Flink, AggregatedCommitter cannot be supported to run in JM, so we are also carrying translation adaptation. Writer and Committer will act as pre-operators, packaged by Flink’s ProcessFunction, supports concurrent pre-delivery and write, and implement two-phase commitment based on Flink’s Checkpoint mechanism. This is also the current 2PC implementation of many of Flink connectors. The ProcessFunction can send messages about pre-commits to downstream Aggregated committers, which can be wrapped around operators such as SinkFunction or ProcessFunction. Of course, We need to ensure that only one single parallel will be started by the AggregatedCommitter in case of the broken of the logic of the aggregated commitment.</p><p>Thank you for watching.

Editor | Test Engineer Feng Xiulan</p><p>For importing billions of batches of data, the traditional JDBC approach does not perform as well as it should in some massive data synchronization scenarios. To write data faster, Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) has just released version 2.1.1 to provide support for ClickhouseFile-Connector to implement Bulk load data writing.</p><p>Bulk load means synchronizing large amounts of data to the target DB. SeaTunnel currently supports data synchronization to ClickHouse.</p><p>At the Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) April Meetup, Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) contributor Fan Jia shared the topic of &quot;ClickHouse bulk load implementation based on SeaTunnel&quot;, explaining in detail the implementation principle and process of ClickHouseFile for efficient processing of large amounts of data.</p><p>Thanks to the test engineer Feng Xiulan for the article arrangement!</p><p>This presentation contains seven parts.</p><ul><li>State of ClickHouse Sink</li><li>Scenarios that ClickHouse Sink isn&#x27;t good at </li><li>Introduction to the ClickHouseFile plugin</li><li>ClickHouseFile core technologies</li><li>Analysis of ClickHouseFile plugin implementation</li><li>Comparison of plug-in capabilities</li><li>Post-optimization directions</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/0-1-56defefcc273a6e21b09dd483bf95914.png" width="1171" height="1171" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Fan Jia,  Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) contributor, Senior Enginee of WhaleOps.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="01-status-of-clickhouse-sink">01 Status of ClickHouse Sink<a href="#01-status-of-clickhouse-sink" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 01 Status of ClickHouse Sink" title="Direct link to 01 Status of ClickHouse Sink">​</a></h2><p>At present, the process of synchronizing data from SeaTunnel to ClickHouse is as follows: as long as the data source is supported by SeaTunnel, the data can be extracted, converted (or not), and written directly to the ClickHouse sink connector, and then written to the ClickHouse server via JDBC. </p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/1-76284c6612152506e0111e0f0d25d0f5.png" width="1139" height="585" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>However, there are some problems with writing to the ClickHouse server via traditional JDBC.</p><p>Firstly, the tool used now is the driver provided by ClickHouse and implemented via HTTP, however, HTTP is not very efficient to implement in certain scenarios. The second is the huge amount of data, if there is duplicate data or a large amount of data written at once, it needs to generate the corresponding insert statement and send it via HTTP to the ClickHouse server-side by the traditional method, where it is parsed and executed item by item or in batches, which does not allow data compression.</p><p>Finally, there is the problem we often encounter, i.e. too much data may lead to an OOM on the SeaTunnel side or a server-side hang due to too much data being written to the server-side too often.</p><p>So we thought, is there a faster way to send than HTTP? If data pre-processing or data compression could be done on the SeaTunnel side, then the network bandwidth pressure would be reduced and the transmission rate would be increased.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="02-scenarios-that-clickhouse-sink-isnt-good-at">02 Scenarios that ClickHouse Sink isn&#x27;t good at<a href="#02-scenarios-that-clickhouse-sink-isnt-good-at" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 02 Scenarios that ClickHouse Sink isn&#x27;t good at" title="Direct link to 02 Scenarios that ClickHouse Sink isn&#x27;t good at">​</a></h2><ol><li>If the HTTP transfer protocol is used, HTTP may not be able to handle it when the volume of data is too large and the batch is sending requests in micro-batches.</li><li>Too many INSERT requests may put too much pressure on the server. The bandwidth can handle a large number of requests, but the server-side is not always able to carry them. The online server not only needs data inserts but more importantly, the query data can be used by other business teams. If the server cluster goes down due to too much-inserted data, it is more than worth the cost.</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="03-clickhouse-file-core-technologies">03 ClickHouse File core technologies<a href="#03-clickhouse-file-core-technologies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 03 ClickHouse File core technologies" title="Direct link to 03 ClickHouse File core technologies">​</a></h2><p>In response to these scenarios that ClickHouse is not good at, we wondered is there a way to do data compression right on the Spark side, without increasing the resource load on the Server when writing data, and with the ability to write large amounts of data quickly? So we developed the ClickHouseFile plugin to solve the problem.</p><p>The key technology of the ClickHouseFile plugin is ClickHouse -local. ClickHouse-local mode allows users to perform fast processing of local files without having to deploy and configure a ClickHouse Server. C lickHouse-local uses the same core as ClickHouse Server, so it supports most features as well as the same format and table engine.</p><p>These two features mean that users can work directly with local files without having to do the processing on the ClickHouse Server side. Because it is the same format, the data generated by the operations we perform on the remote or SeaTunnel side is seamlessly compatible with the server-side and can be written to using ClickHouse local. ClickHouse local is the core technology for the implementation of ClickHouseFile, which allows for implementing the ClickHouse file connector.</p><p>ClickHouse local core is used in the following ways.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2-2367f70ae655c30a94a2ec65e67a6b26.png" width="1112" height="262" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>First line: pass the data to the test_table table of the ClickHouse-local program via the Linux pipeline.</p><p>Lines two to five: create a result_table for receiving data.</p><p>The sixth line: pass data from test_table to the result_table.</p><p>Line 7: Define the disk path for data processing.</p><p>By calling the Clickhouse-local component, the Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) is used to generate the data files and compress the data. By communicating with the Server, the generated data is sent directly to the different nodes of Clickhouse and the data files are then made available to the nodes for the query.</p><p>Comparison of the original and current implementations.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/3-6204c709b48243f88914bfd492dc67f2.png" width="1272" height="576" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Originally, the data, including the insert statements was sent by Spark to the server, and the server did the SQL parsing, generated and compressed the table data files, generated the corresponding files, and created the corresponding indexes. If we use ClickHouse local technology, the data file generation, file compression and index creation are done by SeaTunnel, and the final output is a file or folder for the server-side, which is synchronized to the server and the server can queries the data without additional operations.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="04-core-technical-points">04 Core technical points<a href="#04-core-technical-points" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 04 Core technical points" title="Direct link to 04 Core technical points">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/4-d47e1da865afa7ea4de50b2d6e4b6ac1.png" width="1164" height="435" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The above process makes data synchronization more efficient, thanks to three optimizations we have made to it.</p><p>Firstly, the data is transferred from the pipeline to the ClickHouseFile by the division, which imposes limitations in terms of length and memory. For this reason, we write the data received by the ClickHouse connector, i.e. the sink side, to a temporary file via MMAP technology, and then the ClickHouse local reads the data from the temporary file to generate our target local file, in order to achieve the effect of incremental data reading and solve the OM problem.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/5-9f00635b1727843f705cd5a28632e2e4.png" width="1206" height="565" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Secondly, it supports sharding. If only one file or folder is generated in a cluster, the file is distributed to only one node, which will greatly reduce the performance of the query. Therefore, we carry out slicing support. Users can set the key for slicing in the configuration folder, and the algorithm will divide the data into multiple log files and write them to different cluster nodes, significantly improving the read performance.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/6-35b30550d6a18fbea49856083aa85094.png" width="1043" height="558" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The third key optimization is file transfer. Currently, SeaTunnel supports two file transfer methods, one is SCP, which is characterized by security, versatility, and no additional configuration; the other is RSYNC, which is somewhat fast and efficient and supports breakpoint resume, but requires additional configuration, users can choose between the way suits their needs.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="05-plugin-implementation-analysis">05 Plugin implementation analysis<a href="#05-plugin-implementation-analysis" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 05 Plugin implementation analysis" title="Direct link to 05 Plugin implementation analysis">​</a></h2><p>In summary, the general implementation process of ClickHouseFile is as follows.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/7-1be978da30a55fe0289c683f2ae61aac.png" width="533" height="635" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>1.caching data to the ClickHouse sink side.

He has many years of experience in big data platform development and management, and has rich research experience in data assets, data lineage mapping, data governance, OLAP, and other fields.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="01-background">01 Background<a href="#01-background" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 01 Background" title="Direct link to 01 Background">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/1-198d9a9b685f80a9814d5620d1194355.png" width="1166" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>At present, Kidswant’s OLAP platform consists of seven parts: metadata layer, task layer, storage layer, SQL layer, scheduling layer, service layer, and monitoring layer. This sharing focuses on offline tasks in the task layer.</p><p>In fact, Kidswant had a complete internal collection and push system, but due to some historical legacy issues, the company’s existing platform could not quickly support the OLAP platform getting online, so at that time the company had to abandon its own platform and start developing a new system instead.
There were three options in front of OLAP at the time.</p><p>1, Re-develop the collection and push system.</p><p>2、Self-R&amp;D.</p><p>3, Participate in open source projects.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="02-big-data-processing-mainstream-tools-comparison">02 Big data processing mainstream tools comparison<a href="#02-big-data-processing-mainstream-tools-comparison" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 02 Big data processing mainstream tools comparison" title="Direct link to 02 Big data processing mainstream tools comparison">​</a></h2><p>These three options have their own pros and cons. Carrying re-research and development based on the collection and push system is convenient for us to take advantage of the experience of previous results and avoid repeatedly stepping into the pit. But the disadvantage is that it requires a large amount of code, time, a longer research period, and with less abstract code and lots of customized functions bound to the business, it’s difficult to do the re-development.</p><p>If completely self-developed, though the development process is autonomous and controllable, some engines such as Spark can be done to fit our own architecture, while the disadvantage is that we may encounter some unknown problems.</p><p>For the last choice, if we use open-source frameworks, the advantage is that there is more abstract code, and the framework can be guaranteed in terms of performance and stability after verification by other major companies. Therefore Kidswant mainly studied three open-source data synchronization tools, DATAX, Sqoop, and SeaTunnel in the early stages of OLAP data synchronization refactoring.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/2-fa4598ecce2b564564a8dfb2f7ccae87.png" width="919" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>From the diagram we can see that Sqoop’s main function is data synchronization for RDB, and its implementation is based on MAP/REDUCE. Sqoop has rich parameters and command lines to perform various operations. The advantage of Sqoop is that it fits Hadoop ecology, and already supports most of the conversion from RDB to HIVE arbitrary source, with a complete set of commands and APIs.</p><p>The disadvantages are that Sqoop only supports RDB data synchronization and has some limitations on data files, and there is no concept of data cleansing yet.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/3-53716e33ac191ff35ff66591ba4e1711.png" width="1174" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>DataX mainly aims at synchronizing data from any source by configurable files + multi-threading, which runs three main processes: Reader, Framework, and Writer, where Framework mainly plays the role of communication and leaving empty space.</p><p>The advantage of DataX is that it uses plug-in development, has its own flow control and data control, and is active in the community, with DataX’s official website offering data pushes from many different sources. The disadvantage of DataX, however, is that it is memory-based and there may be limitations on the amount of data available.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/4-1897837b0d7e4b52bc086c94b5aa4aea.png" width="1025" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) also does data synchronization from any source and implements the process in three steps: source, transform and sink based on configuration files, Spark or Flink. </p><p>The advantage is that the current 2.1.0 version has a very large number of plug-ins and source pushes, based on the idea of plug-ins also makes it very easy to extend and embrace Spark and Flink while with a distributed architecture. The only downside to Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) is probably the lack of IP calls at the moment and the need to manage the UI interface by yourself.</p><p>In summary, although Sqoop is distributed, it only supports data synchronization between RDB and HIVE, Hbase and has poor scalability, which is not convenient for re-development. DataX is scalable and stable overall, but because it is a standalone version, it cannot be deployed in a distributed cluster, and there is a strong dependency between data extraction capability and machine performance. SeaTunnel, on the other hand, is similar to DataX and makes up for the flaw of non-distributed DataX. It also supports real-time streaming, and the community is highly active as a new product. We chose SeaTunnel based on a number of factors such as whether it supported distributed or not, and whether it needed to be deployed on a separate machine.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="03-implementation">03 Implementation<a href="#03-implementation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 03 Implementation" title="Direct link to 03 Implementation">​</a></h2><p>On the Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) website, we can see that the basic process of Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) consists of three parts: source, transform and sink. According to the guidelines on the website, Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) requires a configuration script to start, but after some research, we found that the final execution of Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) is bansed on an application submitted by spark-submit that relies on the config file.</p><p>This initialization, although simple, has the problem of having to rely on the config file, which is generated and then cleared after each run, and although it can be dynamically generated in the scheduling script, it raises two questions: 1) whether frequent disk operations make sense; and 2) whether there is a more efficient way to support Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating).</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/5-c2ec6a581e98f15b50a0925325be6acf.png" width="1196" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>With these considerations in mind, we added a Unified Configuration Template Platform module to the final design solution. Scheduling is done by initiating a commit command, and Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) itself pulls the configuration information from the unified configuration template platform, then loads and initializes the parameters.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/6-5d4653fed2f38a65b3e8c04428e1d53e.png" width="1048" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The diagram above shows the business process for Kidswant’s OLAP, which is divided into three sections. The overall flow of data from Parquet, i.e. Hive, through the Parquet tables to KYLIN and CK source.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/7-2eed2f9ff97c6bfcc712e992568dd102.png" width="1080" height="687" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This is the page where we construct the model, which is generated mainly through drag and drop, with some transactional operations between each table, and micro-processing for Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) on the right.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/8-8d444012b45ea1a51088db223d29efa6.png" width="1247" height="596" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>So we end up submitting the commands as above, where the first one marked in red is <!-- -->[-conf customconfig/jars]<!-- -->, referring to the fact that the user can then unify the configuration template platform for processing, or specify it separately when modeling. The last one marked in red is <!-- -->[421 $start_time $end_time $taskType]<!-- --> Unicode, which is a unique encoding.</p><p>Below, on the left, are the 38 commands submitted by our final dispatch script. Below, on the right, is a modification made for Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating), and you can see a more specific tool class called WaterdropContext. It can first determine if Unicode exists and then use Unicode_code to get the configuration information for the different templates, avoiding the need to manipulate the config file.</p><p>In the end, the reportMeta is used to report some information after the task is completed, which is also done in Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating).</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/9-54db46eb9209112af1884f1ef6454536.png" width="720" height="752" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/10-0472de8100ba32800e40ea9e86f3b35f.png" width="1280" height="585" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/11-910cd332e1ebf6b9d7d3ea9186a5c8fa.png" width="1280" height="512" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In the finalized config file as above, it is worth noting that in terms of transforms, Kidswant has made some changes. The first is to do desensitization for mobile phones or ID numbers etc. If the user specifies a field, they do it by field, if not they will scan all fields and then desensitize and encrypt them according to pattern matching.</p><p>Second, transform also supports custom processing, as mentioned above when talking about OLAP modeling. With the addition of HideStr, the first ten fields of a string of characters can be retained and all characters at the back encrypted, providing some security in the data.</p><p>Then, on the sink side, we added pre_sql in order to support the idempotency of the task, which is mainly done for tasks such as data deletion, or partition deletion, as the task cannot be run only once during production, and this design needed to account for the data deviation and correctness once operations such as reruns or complement occur.</p><p>On the right side of the diagram, on the Sink side of a Clickhouse, we have added an is_senseless_mode, which forms a read/write senseless mode, where the user does not perceive the whole area when querying and complementing but uses the CK partition conversion, i.e. the command called MOVE PARTITION TO TABLE to operate.</p><p>A special note here is the Sink side of KYLIN. KYLIN is a very special source with its own set of data entry logic and its monitoring page, so the transformation we have done on KYLIN is simply a call to its API operation and a simple API call and constant polling of the state when using KYLIN, so the resources for KYLIN are limited in the Unified Template Configuration platform.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/12-859f200352aab300d0e421ba01e86da6.png" width="1249" height="586" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="04-common-problems-about-the-apache-seatunnel-incubating-transformation">04 Common problems about the Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) transformation<a href="#04-common-problems-about-the-apache-seatunnel-incubating-transformation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 04 Common problems about the Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) transformation" title="Direct link to 04 Common problems about the Apache SeaTunnel (Incubating) transformation">​</a></h2><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="01-oom--too-many-parts">01 OOM &amp; Too Many Parts<a href="#01-oom--too-many-parts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 01 OOM &amp; Too Many Parts" title="Direct link to 01 OOM &amp; Too Many Parts">​</a></h4><p>The problem usually arises during the Hive to Hive process, even if we go through automatic resource allocation, but there are cases where the data amount suddenly gets bigger, for example after holding several events. Such problems can only be avoided by manually and dynamically tuning the reference and adjusting the data synchronization batch time. In the future, we may try to control the data volume to achieve fine control.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="02-field-and-type-inconsistency-issues">02 Field and type inconsistency issues<a href="#02-field-and-type-inconsistency-issues" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 02 Field and type inconsistency issues" title="Direct link to 02 Field and type inconsistency issues">​</a></h4><p>When the model runs, the user will make some changes to the upstream tables or fields that the task depends on, and these changes may lead to task failure if they are not perceived.

If the same fields are used between multiple cubes, the problem of KYLIN global dictionary lock will be encountered.
